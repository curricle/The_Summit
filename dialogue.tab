BTAO01_7f83626a	Narrator	You notice a familiar face glimpsing up at the moons. While you didn't speak to Tao in the Scholomance, you'd heard of them, in fact, their name was usually mentioned when exam results were posted -- Tao, like Melody, was always at the top.	game/script.rpy	1481	Narrator "[what]"

BTAO01_caa1fa45	Narrator	You look up at a miniturised replica of the night sky. Two lunar bodies orbitting one another.	game/script.rpy	1535	Narrator "[what]"
BTAO01_148f14ad	Narrator	They produce a faint, magical light that feels warm on your skin. Tao seems to smile as you inspect it.	game/script.rpy	1536	Narrator "[what]"
BTAO01_6ddd714f	Narrator	Part of you wonders how magic like this is crafted.	game/script.rpy	1538	Narrator "[what]"
BTAO01_bb4acdea	Narrator	You feel something in you the resonates with it, as though when you reach out you can touch it. It's like touching a pond with your mind.	game/script.rpy	1539	Narrator "[what]"
BTAO01_11ff12a1	Narrator	Every ripple seems to shift the density of magic in the room. The more you try and notice it, the harder it gets to decipher.	game/script.rpy	1540	Narrator "[what]"
BTAO01_06fe3615	Narrator	You pull away. Tao doesn't shift. They clearly see more of what is going on than you do.	game/script.rpy	1541	Narrator "[what]"
BTAO01_bb1c738c	Narrator	It's like they're looking into each individual thread of a complex blanket, while all you can see is the zig-zagging pattern it forms.	game/script.rpy	1542	Narrator "[what]"

BARI01_12a0f1bd	Narrator	You tap the womans shoulder, her attention seems drawn toward the stained glass at the far end of the room.	game/script.rpy	1565	Narrator "[what]"
BARI01_d8c9ca4f	Narrator	Through it, lit by only moonlight, you notice the branch of a tree.	game/script.rpy	1566	Narrator "[what]"
BARI01_361a287a	Narrator	You can't help but notice her smell. Lavender. Quite strong, too. It reminds you of the fields outside the city.	game/script.rpy	1567	Narrator "[what]"
BARI01_59d5ec5e	Aria	Oh, it's you! Maybe you don't remember me from the Scholomance. I'm Aria.	game/script.rpy	1572	Aria "[what]"

BARI01_419bfd0f	Aria	You're pretty funny. Why didn't our paths cross at the Scholomance?	game/script.rpy	1585	Aria "[what]"
BARI01_0fbd13e1	Aria	Oh no, I'm not. I hate being alone.	game/script.rpy	1588	Aria "[what]"
BARI01_8411e9df		I know what you mean.	game/script.rpy	1589	"[what]"
BARI01_6090ddf2	Aria	I can't imagine being like them. Stuck inside stone walls, in meetings all the time... sounds frustrating.	game/script.rpy	1593	Aria "[what]"
BARI01_a9e521df	Aria	at least we've got however long these exams last.	game/script.rpy	1601	Aria "[what]"

BARI01_21ca17af	Aria	Hm, you're not like the other student's here. I'll leave you to it. Good luck on the exams. Let me know if you need help.	game/script.rpy	1605	Aria "[what]"
BXAN01_9ff313c7	Narrator	You'd seen the man approaching you before. Though, usually, his hair was burned or half-alight whenever he drew your attention.	game/script.rpy	1622	Narrator "[what]"
BXAN01_f53b7983	Narrator	Now, he looks oddly put together, even his uniform is somewhat crisp, even if he's not wearing it correctly.	game/script.rpy	1623	Narrator "[what]"
BXAN01_f98b53a7	Xander	You look kinda familiar...	game/script.rpy	1627	Xander "[what]"

BXAN01_4aef1eb5	Xander	Uh, I must've been busy trying to keep up with studying.	game/script.rpy	1632	Xander "[what]"
BXAN01_f25f1a0e	Xander	That's why I don't really remember you. Anyway, we both made it to the Summit in the end. This place makes me feel like I ate a big old goat, horns and all, and it's not settling well.	game/script.rpy	1633	Xander "[what]"
BXAN01_26e258cd	Xander	Thank the Saints... I was worried because I couldn't place you. We have a lot on our minds this week, heh?	game/script.rpy	1636	Xander "[what]"
BXAN01_c0bc29d8	Xander	Anywho... glad we're finally in the graduation group.	game/script.rpy	1638	Xander "[what]"

BMEL01_388b61a2	Narrator	A familiar face approaches you. Her bright eyes and warm smile seem almost contagious.	game/script.rpy	1657	Narrator "[what]"
BMEL01_0556a574	Melody	So good to meet you! I think we met a few times back at the Scholomance. Melody, like a song, that sort of melody.	game/script.rpy	1661	Melody "[what]"
BMEL01_a6514186	Melody	It's so nice to see you again, when I heard who the graduating class were this time, I wanted to chat to you but everything got so busy, you know?	game/script.rpy	1662	Melody "[what]"
BMEL01_03703f87	Melody	If you need anything, like a chat, some gossip, a cup of tea, come talk to me. I've done a {i}lot{/i} of studying so I can help you with whatever you need.	game/script.rpy	1663	Melody "[what]"
BMEL01_5509659e	Melody	Good! Good. I wish I'd talked to you back at the Scholomance, but that place was such a mess of Mages and mayhem so I just never found the time. Really sorry.	game/script.rpy	1666	Melody "[what]"
BMEL01_aed33075	Melody	Oh you're nervous? I'm nervous, too. I'm sort of a nervous chatterer - just ask my old dorm mates. Sorry, I guess I'll leave you be.	game/script.rpy	1669	Melody "[what]"
BMEL01_c4421060	Melody	Anyway, I'll let you chat with everyone else. We're gonna be stuck together for a week, might as well get friendly.	game/script.rpy	1671	Melody "[what]"
BMEL01_d0cccb7d	Narrator	With a quick, but earnest wave, she steps away.	game/script.rpy	1673	Narrator "[what]"

BREX01_b937e4c6	Rex	What do you want?	game/script.rpy	1695	Rex "[what]"
BREX01_2c206626	Rex	Didn't see you at the Scholomance... then again, I guess I kept to myself most of the time. Just try and stay outta my way, alright?	game/script.rpy	1698	Rex "[what]"
BREX01_8cc9e1b7	Rex	Alright. Buzz off then.	game/script.rpy	1701	Rex "[what]"

HMEL01_add16ea5	Melody	Oh, you wanna know about the light spell? Sure… here.	game/script.rpy	1935	Melody "[what]"
HMEL01_c58080ae	Melody	It's simple enough, then again lights something I've always been good at so I picked it up pretty quick.	game/script.rpy	1936	Melody "[what]"
HMEL01_7134ba5c	Narrator	She hands you a page torn from an old book. You take a moment to read it. You wonder whether she was allowed to remove it, but stash it anyway.	game/script.rpy	1938	Narrator "[what]"
HMEL01_1299f66e	Melody	If you end up roaming around at night, make sure you use it. I don't want you getting lost or something. Ha ha.	game/script.rpy	1944	Melody "[what]"
HMEL01_ef4451b9	Melody	Probably wise. Inquisitor Eileen seems strict. I doubt either of us would want her shouting at us.	game/script.rpy	1949	Melody "[what]"
HMEL02_3a6aae89	Melody	Of course I'll help you with potions. It's like, the thing I know best.	game/script.rpy	1956	Melody "[what]"
HMEL02_ad17dd6e	Melody	The book they give you, it's not always right, or well, it's often really incomplete.	game/script.rpy	1957	Melody "[what]"
HMEL02_7dbda260	Melody	If I were you, I'd just try new stuff and see if it works, as long as you're following the rules regarding energy and colour you'll be fine.	game/script.rpy	1958	Melody "[what]"
HMEL02_be99a25d	Melody	I like matching reds, you know, like ember cherries, it means I ended up with a powerful potion.	game/script.rpy	1959	Melody "[what]"
HMEL02_6c6741a9	Melody	It all sounds a bit too simple but potions are often just a balancing act in order to bring out the magical or medicinal properties within them.	game/script.rpy	1960	Melody "[what]"
HMEL02_96a804e6	Melody	Give it a shot.	game/script.rpy	1961	Melody "[what]"
HMEL02_65187f2f	Melody	Hope I helped! Let me know how it goes, yeah?	game/script.rpy	1966	Melody "[what]"
HMEL02_26acfde8	Melody	Exactly. That's how I do it, and I always do well on my potion mixing.	game/script.rpy	1971	Melody "[what]"
HMEL03_1b345c63	Melody	Tao... right. Look, I'm going to be honest here. I don't like Tao -- don't tell them, obviously, it's probably just me being a bit antsy, but one time Tao ratted me out to Eileen.	game/script.rpy	1983	Melody "[what]"
HMEL03_dfecd9f9	Melody	I just don't trust them. They screwed me over and I'm pretty sure they screwed Aria over at one point too -- at least that's what I've heard.	game/script.rpy	1984	Melody "[what]"
HMEL03_7df1a21d	Melody	This stays between us, right?	game/script.rpy	1986	Melody "[what]"
HMEL03_ebe7f8f3	Melody	Great. Sorry, I really don't want to be mean, I just don't trust them.	game/script.rpy	1993	Melody "[what]"
HMEL03_aae14066	Narrator	She looks relieved.	game/script.rpy	1995	Narrator "[what]"
HMEL04_11ba2d79	Melody	Aria? We never really started talking. I should change that. Just {i}so{/i} busy, you know?	game/script.rpy	2005	Melody "[what]"
HMEL04_06ac6692	Melody	Maybe busy isn't the right way of putting it.	game/script.rpy	2008	Melody "[what]"
HMEL04_b0278714	Melody	I mean, back at the Scholomance I really didn't make new friends unless they approached me… not because I didn't want to but because I just felt like I didn't want to intrude.	game/script.rpy	2009	Melody "[what]"
HMEL04_67a985e7	Melody	From what I understand, Aria is very 'go with the flow.' It's like, parallel lines, you know? We're not gonna meet without external influence.	game/script.rpy	2010	Melody "[what]"
HMEL04_0d2475ff	Melody	I'll get round to it before graduation… She doesn't seem to be doing so well and I don't wanna stress her out right now.	game/script.rpy	2013	Melody "[what]"
HMEL04_a4cc3fef	Melody	Trust me, I won't.	game/script.rpy	2016	Melody "[what]"
HMEL04_0d2475ff_1	Melody	I'll get round to it before graduation… She doesn't seem to be doing so well and I don't wanna stress her out right now.	game/script.rpy	2021	Melody "[what]"
HMEL04_a4cc3fef_1	Melody	Trust me, I won't.	game/script.rpy	2024	Melody "[what]"
HMEL05_e746e111	Melody	Rex is a bit troubled… I'd stay out of his way. I think deep down he's sweet, but you have to get past the exterior, and there's not enough time for that and exams.	game/script.rpy	2031	Melody "[what]"
HMEL05_e186796a	Melody	If I'm honest, I only really know Rex by persona alone. I was in the cafeteria when he set Lionel Robyn's cloak on fire.	game/script.rpy	2032	Melody "[what]"
HMEL05_82582696	Melody	He's memorable...	game/script.rpy	2033	Melody "[what]"
HMEL05_16457497	Melody	Their cloak. Lionel was a bit of a bully so no one really cared.	game/script.rpy	2037	Melody "[what]"
HMEL05_b7ac257a	Melody	From my perspective, it was two troublemakers getting into a spat. Very much a spectator sport for the rest of us.	game/script.rpy	2038	Melody "[what]"
HMEL05_f04e11b5	Melody	A couple of times, not about anything important though.	game/script.rpy	2041	Melody "[what]"
HMEL05_39a97940	Melody	He's not the studious type so our chances of meeting randomly in the library or study hall was low.	game/script.rpy	2042	Melody "[what]"
HMEL06_0ac98729	Melody	Uhh, Xander's a mixed bag. He's really good at fighting.	game/script.rpy	2052	Melody "[what]"
HMEL06_38a15e52	Melody	I used to watch him zip around in the courtyard but, well, he's not the best at remembering things.	game/script.rpy	2053	Melody "[what]"
HMEL06_c7a2ffba	Melody	I think he gets in his head. If I had time to tutor him, he'd probably do good. 	game/script.rpy	2054	Melody "[what]"
HMEL06_4a73a33d	Melody	I used to, when I had more time for it.	game/script.rpy	2057	Melody "[what]"
HMEL06_943457c3	Melody	Either way, Xander will probably do fine, as long as he doesn't let himself collapse under the pressure of passing.	game/script.rpy	2058	Melody "[what]"
HMEL07_936a5bf4	Melody	I don't know what I can say about Eileen without sounding a bit mean…	game/script.rpy	2067	Melody "[what]"
HMEL07_823859d6	Melody	Watching her makes me wonder what went so wrong in her life that she ended up so mean and spiteful.	game/script.rpy	2068	Melody "[what]"
HMEL07_cef34bc7	Melody	She's scary, but deep down I think she does care.	game/script.rpy	2069	Melody "[what]"
HMEL07_e7ed40e1	Melody	Even though she's certainly the most brutal of the instructors, I get the feeling she wants what's best for us, but best for her means something very different.	game/script.rpy	2070	Melody "[what]"
HMEL08_abaaab46	Melody	Oh, I like Alice. She's... helpful, it sure is nice to have a teacher who cares.	game/script.rpy	2080	Melody "[what]"
HMEL08_22d5972a	Melody	I'm pretty sure without Alice, Aria would've been kicked out with all the mess she ends up in.	game/script.rpy	2081	Melody "[what]"
HMEL08_35d6d78a	Melody	Yeah, she can be quite destructive with her spells. I've seen her pull up the flooring a few times when working with her magic.	game/script.rpy	2086	Melody "[what]"
HMEL08_34892f9a	Melody	Property damage doesn't sit well with the council, but she never really got punished for it. I think Alice is very on her side.	game/script.rpy	2087	Melody "[what]"
HMEL09_df2caa3c	Melody	You saw Alice in the forest? It was probably just one of her dolls.	game/script.rpy	2095	Melody "[what]"
HMEL09_75806f38	Melody	I don't know what you mean by 'like Alice', but you should probably ask her.	game/script.rpy	2096	Melody "[what]"
HMEL09_b8b83961	Melody	Maybe she messed up a ritual or something -- Geomancy isn't exactly something I'm comfortable with.	game/script.rpy	2097	Melody "[what]"
HMEL10_8c4d13d0	Melody	You want to know about my dreams? I feel like we're at a sleepover or something...	game/script.rpy	2104	Melody "[what]"
HMEL10_3431056a	Narrator	She purses her lips in thought, which seems out of character for someone usually so put together.	game/script.rpy	2106	Narrator "[what]"
HMEL10_e35bdebd	Melody	For now? Graduating. This place has been great but I think we're all over it. Wherever we end up I'm sure we'll all be a lot happier.	game/script.rpy	2107	Melody "[what]"
HMEL10_bd55d565	Melody	Maybe they'll put you and me somewhere close so we can visit… Wait, where do you want to end up?	game/script.rpy	2108	Melody "[what]"
HMEL10_27c125c8		Oh, me too. Maybe they'll take both of us. With that many people around I'm sure we'd never get bored!	game/script.rpy	2111	"[what]"
HMEL10_424bda99	Melody	You're the isolated type, I guess I can see that about you.	game/script.rpy	2115	Melody "[what]"
HMEL10_949060df	Melody	The countryside sounds lovely, I know a lot of old people retire out there. Not sure what there's to do for a mage though.	game/script.rpy	2116	Melody "[what]"
HMEL10_f80179a9	Melody	If you want to be out in the country, you're definitely the perfect candidate for it. Not my cup of tea, but you might be happy there.	game/script.rpy	2117	Melody "[what]"
HMEL10_5bad6252	Melody	Oh, I had enough of that growing up. Sea air's nice but it starts to get oppressive after a while… Then again, I'm pretty picky.	game/script.rpy	2120	Melody "[what]"
HMEL10_eecfa35e	Melody	I used to get called fussy as a kid -- seems like they called me that because I was a bit more meticulous than my parents.	game/script.rpy	2121	Melody "[what]"
HMEL10_15471a72	Melody	I can see the heat and salt water doing you well though, it has a way of mellowing everything over.	game/script.rpy	2122	Melody "[what]"
HMEL10_0091734e	Melody	Plus, the community is tight-knit. If you're looking to make friends, I'm sure you'd be good at it.	game/script.rpy	2123	Melody "[what]"
HMEL10_d6d843ed	Melody	To each their own. This place is cold enough, maybe it's the altitude. I can't imagine having to deal with snow or worse, climbing.	game/script.rpy	2127	Melody "[what]"
HMEL10_84e2d6b1	Melody	You're probably more adventurous than me though. My version of a good time is a nice book and chat with a friend.	game/script.rpy	2128	Melody "[what]"
HMEL10_70924c0c	Melody	Sledding around and taking care of animals is… not for me.	game/script.rpy	2129	Melody "[what]"
HMEL10_0cf6b27c	Melody	Still, wherever we end up, if you're close by, I'll visit. Imagine having the support of a fellow graduate. Who knows what our lives will look like next week.	game/script.rpy	2131	Melody "[what]"
HMEL10_ae19b59a	Melody	You and me both.	game/script.rpy	2134	Melody "[what]"
HMEL10_d69e305e	Melody	Good point, I shouldn't jinx it.	game/script.rpy	2138	Melody "[what]"
HMEL11_8990ee8c	Melody	Getting anxious about exams is completely normal. Try and not worry too much though.	game/script.rpy	2144	Melody "[what]"
HMEL11_5bfad5d4	Melody	If it helps, most people around here are focussing so much on their studies that they aren't being competitive about it.	game/script.rpy	2145	Melody "[what]"
HMEL11_769f40e2	Melody	We all just want to pass. People fail, but you're far more likely to pass if you're in a good mental state. We're all going to pass… well maybe not Xander...	game/script.rpy	2146	Melody "[what]"
HMEL11_839c8fb2	Melody	I'm kidding! Obviously, I hope he passes.	game/script.rpy	2147	Melody "[what]"
HMEL11_2862eaae	Melody	Of course!	game/script.rpy	2150	Melody "[what]"
HMEL11_a3d01541	Melody	Friend! Trust me, you won't! And if you do, you know what the worst situation is, I mean, we were just living it.	game/script.rpy	2153	Melody "[what]"
HMEL11_0716507f	Melody	You go back to the Scholomance until you get put through this place again. It's a setback but you've already been through it. I pinky swear that you'll be fine.	game/script.rpy	2154	Melody "[what]"
HMEL12_fa8fdc3a	Melody	I haven't looked into it -- but I heard the mayor of Ilara City is going to attend our graduation event.	game/script.rpy	2162	Melody "[what]"
HMEL12_5e422c7c	Melody	I've heard about him from a book I read, so I'm imagining that's an option for us. I hope all the spots are close together!	game/script.rpy	2163	Melody "[what]"
HMEL12_763c8e4a	Melody	Crossing my fingers!	game/script.rpy	2166	Melody "[what]"
HMEL13_85979fdf	Melody	It got pretty difficult, for a minute I thought I was going to lose.	game/script.rpy	2174	Melody "[what]"
HMEL13_b19a89f8	Melody	I've probably scraped a pass. Thankfully, it's a collation of all our exam scores that we're marked on.	game/script.rpy	2175	Melody "[what]"
HMEL13_dc6a65b8	Melody	How did you do?	game/script.rpy	2176	Melody "[what]"
HMEL13_b6952f0e	Melody	Hmm. I'm sure you did better than you think...	game/script.rpy	2179	Melody "[what]"
HMEL13_7d14b477	Melody	Glad to hear it.	game/script.rpy	2182	Melody "[what]"
HMEL13_c186d6d4	Melody	At least we can relax now.	game/script.rpy	2183	Melody "[what]"
HMEL14_7b3c84ac	Melody	I'm not used to fighting, I think the combat exam might be the one I'm least prepared for.	game/script.rpy	2189	Melody "[what]"
HMEL14_9684689d	Melody	What can I do except try my best. If you're looking for advice, I'm probably not the best for it. I heard Xander is good at this sorta stuff.	game/script.rpy	2190	Melody "[what]"
HMEL14_30b94ed8	Melody	Sorry I'm not much help here.	game/script.rpy	2193	Melody "[what]"
HMEL15_b5315899	Melody	How'd your exam go?	game/script.rpy	2200	Melody "[what]"
HMEL15_63eb234e	Melody	Huh, it went that badly? I made the same potion as you and mine was fine.	game/script.rpy	2204	Melody "[what]"
HMEL15_91ba9a87	Melody	It should've worked!	game/script.rpy	2205	Melody "[what]"
HMEL15_3111c255	Melody	Maybe Rex messed with your plants or something? I'm so angry for you!	game/script.rpy	2206	Melody "[what]"
HMEL15_496b0df3	Melody	Maybe I shouldn't have said that without proof. I just know he's one to tamper with things.	game/script.rpy	2209	Melody "[what]"
HMEL15_3adaa14d	Melody	Hmm. It's not a complex potion and it certainly shouldn't have backfired in any way.	game/script.rpy	2216	Melody "[what]"
HMEL15_a88e7706	Melody	I am too.	game/script.rpy	2222	Melody "[what]"
HMEL15_cadcfd49	Melody	Aww, I'm sure you did fine!	game/script.rpy	2227	Melody "[what]"
HMEL15_b234432b	Melody	Oh, that's so good. We're past the halfway point. Not long until we're graduating.	game/script.rpy	2230	Melody "[what]"
potionfail_f7a536d6	Melody	Hopefully, you'll still get a pass or maybe a retake option. Sorry you went through that.	game/script.rpy	2235	Melody "[what]"
potionfail_26d571fb	Melody	Did you make sure to submit everything? If you don't submit it might not be marked.	game/script.rpy	2238	Melody "[what]"
HMEL16_ce3a4768	Melody	Everyone's so nervous for the Potion Exam. I guess I've studied enough that I'm feeling pretty calm. I already know the recipe I'll be using -- it'll get me top marks, for sure.	game/script.rpy	2245	Melody "[what]"
HMEL16_b278d7e8	Melody	I've always been the type to plan out things -- I'm not going to go into the exam with no recipe in mind.	game/script.rpy	2248	Melody "[what]"
HMEL16_ee6db01c	Melody	We all have our strengths!	game/script.rpy	2251	Melody "[what]"
HMEL16_e5d5609f	Melody	If you're worried, I don't mind giving you one of my other recipes, you know, as a guide. If you're interested.	game/script.rpy	2254	Melody "[what]"
HMEL16_f17495b0	Melody	Oh, well here you go. Happy to help.	game/script.rpy	2257	Melody "[what]"
HMEL16_99018088	Melody	Anyway, don't be too worried about the exam. I think if you overthink it you'll just end up anxious and unfocused. 	game/script.rpy	2258	Melody "[what]"
HMEL16_3fe8a6c1	Melody	As long as you turn {i}something{/i} in I'm sure you'll pass.	game/script.rpy	2262	Melody "[what]"
HMEL16_99018088_1	Melody	Anyway, don't be too worried about the exam. I think if you overthink it you'll just end up anxious and unfocused. 	game/script.rpy	2263	Melody "[what]"
HMEL17_155c7385	Melody	I'm not versed in artificing.	game/script.rpy	2269	Melody "[what]"
HMEL17_4427bded	Melody	I know enough to get through the exam -- I mean, that's what most of my studying was for -- but I don't think any advice I could give you would help since I barely get it myself.	game/script.rpy	2270	Melody "[what]"
HMEL17_b4d936a3	Melody	Maybe ask Alice, she might slide you a book or something that might help. Oh, you could check the Library.	game/script.rpy	2271	Melody "[what]"
HMEL17_b27ca3f9		Sorry...	game/script.rpy	2274	"[what]"
HMEL17_19e32c42	Melody	If I could, I would. I really don't want to give you bad advice -- I'd feel so guilty if something I did screwed you over.	game/script.rpy	2279	Melody "[what]"
HMEL18_76ff69d8	Melody	Oh, I think I'm like everyone else here. My magic manifesting was not pleasant.	game/script.rpy	2286	Melody "[what]"
HMEL18_031fef3d	Melody	I was pretty young and the town I lived in was getting a really heavy storm.	game/script.rpy	2287	Melody "[what]"
HMEL18_c5eeab9a	Melody	Thunder, lightning, strong winds -- usually it wouldn't freak me out but this time I was just feeling so unsettled that I worked myself into an anxious state...	game/script.rpy	2288	Melody "[what]"
HMEL18_8307cf13	Narrator	Melody brushes her hair with the back of her hand rhythmically -- you can tell she doesn't know she's doing it. The brightness in her eyes seems dulled.	game/script.rpy	2290	Narrator "[what]"
HMEL18_c60aa5b6	Melody	I don't actually remember doing anything myself...	game/script.rpy	2292	Melody "[what]"
HMEL18_ba5ad579	Melody	Like I remember one of my friends at the Scholomance mentioned that they felt the magic, sort of like how I do spellcasting now, but looking back there wasn't any of that.	game/script.rpy	2293	Melody "[what]"
HMEL18_e544c12d	Melody	I went to my room and hid under my covers and read my book. A few hours later, I emerged from my room to find that all the mirrors and windows were fogged over.	game/script.rpy	2294	Melody "[what]"
HMEL18_9c011eeb	Melody	At first I didn't think too much of it, I just thought the storm had done something weird but when I wiped them nothing happened.	game/script.rpy	2295	Melody "[what]"
HMEL18_b16882af	Melody	Every single glass object in my house was opaque, reflecting nothing. Letting nothing through -- even light.	game/script.rpy	2296	Melody "[what]"
HMEL18_0e358a89	Melody	Obviously, that scared me even more and I ended up hiding under my covers again.	game/script.rpy	2298	Melody "[what]"
HMEL18_371e3324	Melody	My parents brought in a few mages to interview me, as they had a suspicion that I had done it inadvertently.	game/script.rpy	2299	Melody "[what]"
HMEL18_3f8b1efd	Melody	None of them could replicate what I did or fix it. It was quite costly to repair but I didn't get to see the new ones, I had already gone to the Scholomance by that point.	game/script.rpy	2301	Melody "[what]"
HMEL18_c1a777d9	Melody	Looking back... it wasn't the worst manifestation I've heard of. I read one instance where a mage inadvertently warped her parents across the country to a holiday spot they'd once visited.	game/script.rpy	2302	Melody "[what]"
HMEL18_f2d9be9d	Melody	When the parents got back they found most of their close friends and family had gone missing, too.	game/script.rpy	2303	Melody "[what]"
HMEL18_3f7f73a6	Melody	This girl had essentially teleported her parents across the country and then done the same again when she went to get help -- over and over. Horrific, right?	game/script.rpy	2304	Melody "[what]"
HMEL18_67ddc689	Melody	It really wasn't. It was expensive, though. I'm sure my mother will tell me the story until she retires. 	game/script.rpy	2307	Melody "[what]"
HMEL18_f597fd01	Melody	I have an affinity for light -- that's what the mages told me, anyway.	game/script.rpy	2310	Melody "[what]"
HMEL18_f2608d98	Melody	It would've been far more boring if I just manifested a little floating light like the spell I use to read -- it would be a bit more in line with my current uses for magic, though...	game/script.rpy	2311	Melody "[what]"
HMEL18_8a675c40	Melody	You know, magic is great to have -- but the daily applications are honestly a little boring. At least with us graduating we'll be capable of applying it in more ways.	game/script.rpy	2313	Melody "[what]"
HMEL18_15924abb	Melody	Light magic's great for agriculture. I saw Tao water their plants with a water spell. Obviously, we're strong enough to protect others too -- well, maybe I'm not but I'm sure you are, same with Xander.	game/script.rpy	2314	Melody "[what]"
HMEL18_46d2f3a9	Melody	Imagine what a mage outside of the Society would look like -- what would we even get up to?	game/script.rpy	2315	Melody "[what]"
HMEL18_e5cdc8c4	Melody	Probably nothing.	game/script.rpy	2316	Melody "[what]"
HMEL18_2ee39929	Melody	Either way, I think every mage here has an interesting story around their manifestation.	game/script.rpy	2317	Melody "[what]"
HMEL18_8fa9ad4b	Melody	I'm quite curious to see whether anyone can get Eileen to tell hers. I have this fear that she'll toss me across the room like a ball if I broach the question.	game/script.rpy	2318	Melody "[what]"
HMEL19a_b5c7f03e	Melody	What a cute question!	game/script.rpy	2323	Melody "[what]"
HMEL19a_136629ef	Melody	Of {i}course{/i} we're friends. Like, I can already see you and me getting super close, you know? I warm up quick.	game/script.rpy	2324	Melody "[what]"
HMEL19b_b2414274	Melody	We've been here like, a few days and I already feel like we've been friends forever. These little chats we have are always so fun.	game/script.rpy	2329	Melody "[what]"
HMEL19c_370649a0	Melody	You're certainly my closest friend here. That might not be saying much but it means a lot to me. I trust you, you know. I hope you trust me, too.	game/script.rpy	2334	Melody "[what]"
HMEL19d_2b000e60	Melody	Ha ha ha haha. {i}I'm in stitches.{/i} You cannot be asking me that right now.	game/script.rpy	2340	Melody "[what]"
HMEL20_086db732	Melody	The idea of a bunch of faceless people managing me for the rest of my life sure isn't nice...	game/script.rpy	2345	Melody "[what]"
HMEL20_5393dd75	Melody	Then again, it seems like it's working out for Alice and Eileen. I'm not big on playing politics -- even if I'm smart enough to get by in that sort of world it seems the opposite of glamorous.	game/script.rpy	2346	Melody "[what]"
HMEL20_0c50fd2f	Melody	It also makes the idea of blowing stuff up seem appealing.	game/script.rpy	2347	Melody "[what]"
HMEL20_2a54ca4e	Melody	Imagine being a mage, capable of what we can all do, and you decide to sit in a boardroom all day making decisions for people you don't care about and who do not care about you.	game/script.rpy	2348	Melody "[what]"
HMEL20_22c627d2	Narrator	Almost as though she's let a facade slip, she puts a smile on her face and looks you in the eye.	game/script.rpy	2350	Narrator "[what]"
HMEL20_91ca79b3	Melody	Wait, that was a bit of a rant, sorry. I'm always optimistic, but bureaucrats, even in the mage world, seem pointless and annoying.	game/script.rpy	2352	Melody "[what]"
HMEL20_7eefc20c	Melody	They should get real jobs, honestly.	game/script.rpy	2353	Melody "[what]"
HMEL20_4b0f7df3	Melody	Surely not. I think authority is important, but authority should benefit everyone. I didn't mind getting sent off to the Scholomance when I was a kid but I would've liked a choice in it.	game/script.rpy	2356	Melody "[what]"
HMEL20_57986684	Melody	It seems silly that they can't devise another option for training future mages.	game/script.rpy	2357	Melody "[what]"
HMEL20_6f366aa4	Melody	If the mages in those seats cared about what us students had to say about it then we'd be given an alternative.	game/script.rpy	2358	Melody "[what]"
xanderhub_main_a00d2aec	Xander	Everything alright, pal?	game/script.rpy	2383	Xander "[what]"
xanderhub_main_8cadf550	Xander	See ya!	game/script.rpy	2462	Xander "[what]"
xanderhub_main_90c391ad	Xander	Later.	game/script.rpy	2465	Xander "[what]"
xanderhub_main_ac5e461a	Xander	Bye.	game/script.rpy	2468	Xander "[what]"
xanderhub_main_ee505069	Xander	Ok, chat later.	game/script.rpy	2471	Xander "[what]"
HXAN01_e4bda542	Xander	Huh -- my past? Like where I grew up and that? Why'd you wanna know?	game/script.rpy	2480	Xander "[what]"
HXAN01_f7ce5534	Xander	Uh, well, we're farmers. Mom and pops have a farm down in a valley. We're not rich, but it's great soil and the winters aren't too bad.	game/script.rpy	2484	Xander "[what]"
HXAN01_82cc464c	Xander	I was doing chores from when I could walk. Cows, chickens, sheep -- you name it, I was feeding it.	game/script.rpy	2485	Xander "[what]"
HXAN01_9163019e	Xander	Farming's not easy. A few bad harvests and your family starves.	game/script.rpy	2486	Xander "[what]"
HXAN01_e5a13d12	Xander	But I loved it. Out every day, working with my hands, talking to the animals.	game/script.rpy	2488	Xander "[what]"
HXAN01_edec4392	Xander	Lots of space and fresh air. Lots of friends too -- although they were all my brothers.	game/script.rpy	2489	Xander "[what]"
HXAN01_f624715f	Xander	We're six boys and I'm... let's see…um…the fifth one. One of us was always up for a game, or a scrap. How do you think I got so good at fighting?	game/script.rpy	2490	Xander "[what]"
HXAN01_d935ecc3	Xander	Uh, well, I grew up on a little farm with my parents down in the valley. I have a bunch of brothers.	game/script.rpy	2494	Xander "[what]"
HXAN01_f888d442	Xander	We're tough boys. Lots of digging holes and building walls. It was pretty good. Animals like me, and I like lifting heavy stuff so… yeah.	game/script.rpy	2495	Xander "[what]"
HXAN02_a77e00cc	Xander	Our farm's known for its beef and milk. I'm proud of that. Cows are smart, you know.	game/script.rpy	2501	Xander "[what]"
HXAN02_252363e4	Xander	We're far from the big towns. Pops has to go into town for supplies every other month. Wouldn't see him for almost a week.	game/script.rpy	2502	Xander "[what]"
HXAN02_322d7dca	Xander	But it was never lonely in the valley. Kids from the other farms came by.	game/script.rpy	2503	Xander "[what]"
HXAN02_963b2960	Xander	My brothers -- there's five of them -- always had some chore or shenanigan in mind for me. I miss the lot of them.	game/script.rpy	2504	Xander "[what]"
HXAN02_7a5775b5	Xander	When I get back, I'll help them out again. They're probably hurting for hands.	game/script.rpy	2505	Xander "[what]"
HXAN03_218cc607	Xander	My manifestation? Heh -- it was actually pretty funny. Me and my brothers were building a fence for the sheep. Real hard work.	game/script.rpy	2510	Xander "[what]"
HXAN03_ebfa30a4	Xander	But we chose that day for it, because we could tell it'd be sunny and dry. There I was, sweat pouring down my face… stinging my eyes...	game/script.rpy	2511	Xander "[what]"
HXAN03_7abeecd9	Xander	and I just wished the fence would build itself. Really, really, wished it... and pop pop, just like that, lightning came out of the sky and destroyed the fence.	game/script.rpy	2512	Xander "[what]"
HXAN03_ec9516d9	Xander	Ha! I couldn't believe it. Six hours of work, gone. All the sheep panicked and ran for it.	game/script.rpy	2513	Xander "[what]"
HXAN04a_2adb6192	Xander	I reckon you'd do well in the Mage Council. You seem to be the type they want.	game/script.rpy	2516	Xander "[what]"
HXAN04b_86408b48	Xander	You seem like a good person. You helped me when I really needed it... sorry I was such a mess about it all. I panicked a little bit, right?	game/script.rpy	2522	Xander "[what]"
HXAN04b_a889d8ee	Xander	I was so focused on how bad I was at things that I didn't stop and think that my talents might not be like Melody's or Tao's. Weird, right, before I got sent to the Scholomance, I never really compared myself to others...	game/script.rpy	2523	Xander "[what]"
HXAN04b_4ff099be	Xander	I guess I didn't need to.	game/script.rpy	2524	Xander "[what]"
HXAN05_9ebdff6e	Xander	Ha! Wanna have a scrap for fun?	game/script.rpy	2528	Xander "[what]"
HXAN05_774078f5	Xander	Oh c'mon, don't be a wimp.	game/script.rpy	2531	Xander "[what]"
HXAN05_fd715203	Xander	Yea, right.	game/script.rpy	2534	Xander "[what]"
HXAN05_25c31f9f	Xander	Remember back at the Scholomance, when we used to have those interhouse fighting tournaments? I won a few, you know. Could've gone all the way to the top, but they kicked me out because I couldn't keep my grades up.	game/script.rpy	2535	Xander "[what]"
HXAN05_af9d0a05	Xander	Ha! You can hold your own. I can tell.	game/script.rpy	2539	Xander "[what]"
HXAN05_aff2c269	Xander	I could've been a Scholomance champion, you know? I competed in the interhouse fighting tournaments.	game/script.rpy	2540	Xander "[what]"
HXAN05_4ccb092a	Xander	Eileen told me I had what it takes to go all the way. But they kicked me out because I couldn't keep my grades up.	game/script.rpy	2541	Xander "[what]"
HXAN05_d03f09ee	Xander	I was so bummed. I never cared about the titles… It was about the thrill.	game/script.rpy	2543	Xander "[what]"
HXAN05_971f33a6	Xander	I'm all intuition. I don't do well when I have to think about everything. Neither does my magic. I just wanna go -- {i}pop, pop, pop{/i} -- and see what happens.	game/script.rpy	2544	Xander "[what]"
HXAN05_3677660b	Xander	You ever feel like that? All cooped up. All this spark but nothing to ignite?	game/script.rpy	2545	Xander "[what]"
HXAN05_2a1599ee	Xander	Guess not...	game/script.rpy	2548	Xander "[what]"
HXAN05_1f05f365	Xander	Or find other ways to get the energy out.	game/script.rpy	2552	Xander "[what]"
HXAN05_75da114d	Xander	I didn't mean for it to come out like that...	game/script.rpy	2556	Xander "[what]"
HXAN05_c41372e4	Xander	Anywho lets talk about somethin' else.	game/script.rpy	2558	Xander "[what]"
HXAN05_c5ae21f4	Xander	I know, right?	game/script.rpy	2561	Xander "[what]"
HXAN05_a1c6dcea	Xander	You'll make it.	game/script.rpy	2564	Xander "[what]"
HXAN06_8aa9d42a	Xander	Mel?	game/script.rpy	2568	Xander "[what]"
HXAN06_5690e0aa	Xander	She's always nice when I ask her stuff. Seems like a genuine person. I think anyone who's nice should do great in life.	game/script.rpy	2570	Xander "[what]"
HXAN06_7addfc4f	Xander	I like her. She tried to help me with the potions exam. I didn't do too well, but she still tried.	game/script.rpy	2573	Xander "[what]"
HXAN07_58bde185	Xander	Tao is a whiny, spoiled rich kid. Wouldn't last a minute on a farm.	game/script.rpy	2577	Xander "[what]"
HXAN07_f3a8b9e2	Xander	I don't hang out with them. One time -- just that one time -- I cheated on a test and Tao ratted me out. Until then I liked them...	game/script.rpy	2578	Xander "[what]"
HXAN07_793b2ebc	Xander	Friends should stick together, you know? I'm not gonna trust someone like that again.	game/script.rpy	2579	Xander "[what]"
HXAN07_31decd0c	Xander	Well, it sure wasn't good.	game/script.rpy	2582	Xander "[what]"
HXAN07_59ba00d9	Xander	Damn right.	game/script.rpy	2585	Xander "[what]"
HXAN08_da95ee51	Xander	Aria? Euh, she's from the country, like me. Do you think she'd like an Owlcat if I caught her one?	game/script.rpy	2589	Xander "[what]"
HXAN08_9e33efb4	Xander	She's the only one who loves animals as much as I do. She'd take care of it.	game/script.rpy	2593	Xander "[what]"
HXAN08_017a4287	Xander	I wanna see the look on her face. She'd love it. Aria's so… sweet and kind. She doesn't put on airs.	game/script.rpy	2596	Xander "[what]"
HXAN08_7f45e21b	Xander	And she's smart.	game/script.rpy	2597	Xander "[what]"
HXAN08_50306c75	Narrator	He looks you dead on. You realise for once, he's serious.	game/script.rpy	2599	Narrator "[what]"
HXAN08_258591cf	Xander	She is. The others don't think so, I heard them talking shit. But one time, I saw her grow a tree through a stone wall. Ha!	game/script.rpy	2601	Xander "[what]"
HXAN08_5c1a9426	Xander	The wall broke right in half like stale bread. How'd she do that? I haven't been able to talk to her since. She makes me too nervous.	game/script.rpy	2602	Xander "[what]"
HXAN09_1436d18f	Xander	Rex? I don't mind him, but I avoid him. Trouble has a way of finding him. Rex has a bad reputation here.	game/script.rpy	2606	Xander "[what]"
HXAN09_12aa68ca	Xander	He's not a bad guy, he just can't get along with anyone, especially the teachers. I just don't get how he survives without any friends.	game/script.rpy	2607	Xander "[what]"
HXAN09_d92f7d4d	Xander	Anyway -- I got to focus on graduating. Rex'll be nothing but a distraction with his antics.	game/script.rpy	2608	Xander "[what]"
HXAN10_01a5b08c	Xander	Um, authority's not a bad thing, because the mages need a leader.	game/script.rpy	2613	Xander "[what]"
HXAN10_cc45dd59	Xander	Someone that tells them how to work together. Where I'm from, everyone has their role to play, and that's how we survive.	game/script.rpy	2614	Xander "[what]"
HXAN10_97865c48		I don't mind following a leader with a good plan.	game/script.rpy	2615	"[what]"
HXAN11_2fd0277a		You wanna know what {i}I{/i} think of Eileen?	game/script.rpy	2619	"[what]"
HXAN11_7b2a6090	Xander	She scares me. Someone told me she's not just a teacher. Her real job is to handle mages for the Council.	game/script.rpy	2621	Xander "[what]"
HXAN11_2c9ded51	Xander	Mages that are strong enough to wreak havoc but don't follow the rules. The Council hates that.	game/script.rpy	2622	Xander "[what]"
HXAN11_7d27ada1	Xander	Eileen's job is to sort them out if they're the destructive kind. If we ever step out of line like that, she'll be sent to take care of us.	game/script.rpy	2623	Xander "[what]"
HXAN11_6e82d562	Xander	Yea, I mean kill. Don't be a baby. Why else would they be making her that huge statue?	game/script.rpy	2626	Xander "[what]"
HXAN11_f8bb3d07	Xander	If I needed a powerful mage to keep other powerful mages in line, I'd try to stay on her good side, right?	game/script.rpy	2627	Xander "[what]"
HXAN11_304779dd	Xander	Give her rewards and stuff. That's the story behind her statue. Or so I heard.	game/script.rpy	2628	Xander "[what]"
HXAN11_c9690bff	Xander	She watched me do a combat test back at the Scholomance.	game/script.rpy	2633	Xander "[what]"
HXAN11_2eab7f59	Xander	Just sat there staring the whole time. I'm pretty sure she doesn't like me.	game/script.rpy	2634	Xander "[what]"
HXAN11_4f1c0e2f	Xander	I never expected Eileen to give me advice. She's real intimidating.	game/script.rpy	2639	Xander "[what]"
HXAN11_8dcaf1ae	Xander	And you know what the weirdest part is? I think she's right. I'm not good at anything other than fighting.	game/script.rpy	2640	Xander "[what]"
HXAN11_46f41d42	Xander	Neither is she when you get down to the heart of it. I wonder if she'd take on an apprentice? There's no way I'm passing all exams, so maybe another path is out there.	game/script.rpy	2641	Xander "[what]"
HXAN11_d1951aa8	Xander	I dunno. I just know I'm not cut out for this place.	game/script.rpy	2644	Xander "[what]"
HXAN11_6ac7523b	Xander	Everyone needs someone. Learned that one the hard way.	game/script.rpy	2648	Xander "[what]"
HXAN12_03a0eca2	Xander	Heh… Alice reminds me of a hen we have on the farm. Runs around clucking at everyone about everything, but never laid one egg.	game/script.rpy	2652	Xander "[what]"
HXAN12_3b489204	Xander	I dunno how much help she's been. She keeps telling me to study, but never tells me what I'm doing wrong.	game/script.rpy	2653	Xander "[what]"
HXAN13a_60ad969a	Xander	I'd say we're friends, right?	game/script.rpy	2657	Xander "[what]"
HXAN13a_04947a46	Xander	We're all at the Summit together, same with Melody and Aria. It's not a competition if we're all trying to pass, right?	game/script.rpy	2658	Xander "[what]"
HXAN13a_a38c9409	Xander	Right?	game/script.rpy	2659	Xander "[what]"
HXAN13b_d630d57c	Xander	Yea, you're my buddy. You never held my freak outs against me.	game/script.rpy	2666	Xander "[what]"
HXAN13b_69bd25d2	Xander	And anyone who went through what the Scholomance put us through is my friend. Well, almost everyone.	game/script.rpy	2667	Xander "[what]"
HXAN14_0273c92f	Xander	The Mage Council? My plan is to lay low after Scholomance, and hope they won't notice me. The last thing I wanna do is have to show up to all those functions.	game/script.rpy	2671	Xander "[what]"
HXAN14_d42519df	Xander	To be honest, my dream since I was a kid was to join an Adventure Guild. I wonder if I can still do that after graduation...	game/script.rpy	2672	Xander "[what]"
HXAN14_59ba00d9	Xander	Damn right.	game/script.rpy	2676	Xander "[what]"
HXAN15_37f55c5e	Xander	When I was a kid, adventurers from the Guild travelled through the valley all the time. Sometimes, pops put them up in our barn.	game/script.rpy	2681	Xander "[what]"
HXAN15_79ef93d2	Xander	If a town or village is dealing with an unusual problem, like a great beast or something, they call the Guild.	game/script.rpy	2684	Xander "[what]"
HXAN15_82970077	Xander	The Guild sends Adventurers to deal with the situation. Pays them well and gives them special privileges, too! Well, while they're on the job.	game/script.rpy	2685	Xander "[what]"
HXAN15_fb23a7ec	Xander	It's hard to explain. Like, I don't think about it every day, but I also never forget it.	game/script.rpy	2688	Xander "[what]"
HXAN15_50c7e30f	Xander	When I daydream, it's usually about the Guild. I respect how they fight to protect others, not just for themselves.	game/script.rpy	2689	Xander "[what]"
HXAN15_e1e73d5e	Xander	Maybe. Let me tell you something really weird. I've had my fortune read, you know. An elder in the valley had the gift. She told me I'd die in combat one day.	game/script.rpy	2693	Xander "[what]"
HXAN15_94bcdb52	Xander	My brother thought she probably meant in some village bar brawl. But after the Scholomance, I'm not so sure.	game/script.rpy	2694	Xander "[what]"
HXAN15_84ca9d77	Xander	I figure, if I can get a job in combat, I could get better at it. Then, I might stand a chance of changing my fate when the day comes.	game/script.rpy	2695	Xander "[what]"
HXAN15_9a061ed4	Xander	You got a nose for these things, heh? You're not wrong.	game/script.rpy	2698	Xander "[what]"
HXAN15_5271c8e3	Xander	I've only ever seen one or two adventurers that could do magic, but they were never human, usually elves or horned.	game/script.rpy	2699	Xander "[what]"
HXAN15_26ebe089	Xander	But I figure, I'm a mage that can fight. There's a first time for everything, right?	game/script.rpy	2700	Xander "[what]"
HXAN16_59aa547b	Xander	Glad you're helping me. The spell I used to hide it split it into several pieces that are scattered around the room.	game/script.rpy	2704	Xander "[what]"
HXAN16_c0895211	Xander	No matter what I do, I just can't get the key to reappear whole.	game/script.rpy	2705	Xander "[what]"
HXAN16_b65bf16c	Xander	Can you try, if you got enough mana? Cast the finder spell to locate the pieces of the key.	game/script.rpy	2706	Xander "[what]"
HXAN16_5af4a241	Xander	Once you've found all the pieces, they should just combine magically.	game/script.rpy	2707	Xander "[what]"
HXAN16_57944639	Xander	Saints... who came up with this crap. I get we're in a magic castle but... c'mon.	game/script.rpy	2708	Xander "[what]"
ariahub_main_f6ed6d34	Aria	Did you want to discuss something?	game/script.rpy	2749	Aria "[what]"
ariahub_main_fcd74bce	Aria	Bye for now.	game/script.rpy	2845	Aria "[what]"
ariahub_main_722f88e3	Aria	Ok, talk later.	game/script.rpy	2848	Aria "[what]"
ariahub_main_106c5ea9	Aria	Goodbye.	game/script.rpy	2851	Aria "[what]"
ariahub_main_7dd86004	Aria	Ok, see you later.	game/script.rpy	2854	Aria "[what]"
HARI01a_4bcb4d3a	Aria	My childhood? Um, well, I'm from a pretty small town up in the mountains, far from here. Not sure you'd relate.	game/script.rpy	2865	Aria "[what]"
HARI01a_fa41b3a6	Aria	Back home, I guess you'd say we're old fashioned. We know we have to depend on each other to get by. We only get supplies in the spring and summer. Mountain paths get blocked up quick in the winter.	game/script.rpy	2871	Aria "[what]"
HARI01a_7a14426d	Aria	Pops sells herbal potions and mum hunts. We live a bit outside the town, higher up than anyone else. Not by choice, you know.	game/script.rpy	2872	Aria "[what]"
HARI01a_34d76e3e	Aria	My parents married in secret when my brother was born.	game/script.rpy	2873	Aria "[what]"
HARI01a_d69e4a73	Aria	Some people in the town didn't think they should've married at all, so they went off on their own.	game/script.rpy	2874	Aria "[what]"
HARI01a_53c744ff	Aria	I reckon they did alright for a while. But when I came along, the elders said I came into the world under dark signs.	game/script.rpy	2875	Aria "[what]"
HARI01a_399c0738	Narrator	You notice Aria looking down, her expression troubled. Her fingers play with the seams of her skirt, picking and picking. When she notices you watching her, she forces a smile.	game/script.rpy	2877	Narrator "[what]"
HARI01a_68e35380	Aria	The day I was born the town had its first earthquake. It shook the town so bad. An elder's home was destroyed.	game/script.rpy	2879	Aria "[what]"
HARI01a_a1aff46f	Aria	They were all scared of me after that.	game/script.rpy	2880	Aria "[what]"
HARI01a_441f03b3	Aria	It was so unfair.	game/script.rpy	2881	Aria "[what]"
HARI01a_d5138a6e	Aria	I spent a lot of time looking down on my town, questioning what made them so different from me.	game/script.rpy	2882	Aria "[what]"
HARI01a_318f1db2	Aria	I found my answer the day my magic manifested. My parents didn't like the idea of the Scholomance, they thought it would change me. I thought I didn't have any choice but to go...	game/script.rpy	2883	Aria "[what]"
HARI01a_dbf426a5	Aria	Turns out I was right. Maybe they were, too.	game/script.rpy	2885	Aria "[what]"
HARI01a_24e68b8c	Aria	I know I caused that earthquake. The elder was right.	game/script.rpy	2889	Aria "[what]"
HARI01a_6d928dfd	Aria	I'm certain of it.	game/script.rpy	2893	Aria "[what]"
HARI01b_e81305d6	Aria	We're from a mountain town, far from here. My family lived higher up than everyone else in town.	game/script.rpy	2902	Aria "[what]"
HARI01b_8616e90a	Aria	It was kind of like the four of us, against the world. It made me happy in a weird way.	game/script.rpy	2903	Aria "[what]"
HARI01b_f3258e99	Aria	My parents never told my brother and me what people said about us.	game/script.rpy	2904	Aria "[what]"
HARI01b_9ea8ecdf	Aria	My parents got married in secret when my brother was born.	game/script.rpy	2905	Aria "[what]"
HARI01b_13a8e4a8	Aria	Back home, we're very traditional and lots of people didn't think they should've married because they're from different religions.	game/script.rpy	2907	Aria "[what]"
HARI01b_38092867	Aria	They told mum and pops that their kids would be born weak and sick. It didn't help that when I was born, the town had its first earthquake.	game/script.rpy	2908	Aria "[what]"
HARI01b_6c6c4c04	Aria	It shook the town so bad. An elder's home was destroyed. They were all scared of me after that.	game/script.rpy	2909	Aria "[what]"
HARI01b_928b3dcd	Aria	But still, I guess I'm lucky I had my pops. When my magic manifested, pops knew exactly what it was. He asked the schoolmistress what he should do.	game/script.rpy	2911	Aria "[what]"
HARI01b_297071cd	Aria	She told him I had to go to Scholomance.	game/script.rpy	2912	Aria "[what]"
HARI01b_bab17814	Aria	I wasn't sure about it. It was a strange place, far from everything I knew. But I thought that if I became a mage, I could help the people I care about.	game/script.rpy	2913	Aria "[what]"
HARI01b_30103c45	Aria	The school would teach me how.	game/script.rpy	2914	Aria "[what]"
HARI01b_791cea27	Aria	But I must be doing it wrong, because my powers are getting more and more chaotic. It's like a wild animal that just does what it wants.	game/script.rpy	2915	Aria "[what]"
HARI01b_9293d2f5	Aria	It's me, but it's not me.	game/script.rpy	2916	Aria "[what]"
HARI01b_8be6e243	Aria	I'm {i}not{/i} in control. It's like...	game/script.rpy	2919	Aria "[what]"
HARI01b_a136a6fd	Aria	Imagine walking down a busy road and suddenly a tree falls.	game/script.rpy	2920	Aria "[what]"
HARI01b_a7bfefd6	Aria	Except, it happens constantly. Every time you're on that busy street a tree falls.	game/script.rpy	2921	Aria "[what]"
HARI01b_3779971a	Aria	And these trees are old, thick, goliaths, they've stood for millenia, nothing could break them.	game/script.rpy	2922	Aria "[what]"
HARI01b_6dee9e3f	Aria	And yet every time you're on that street, one falls.	game/script.rpy	2923	Aria "[what]"
HARI01b_fb628a75	Aria	You're the problem. You can't figure out exactly how, but you know it's you.	game/script.rpy	2924	Aria "[what]"
HARI01b_aebed32f	Aria	I know it's me. Everyone knows it's me.	game/script.rpy	2925	Aria "[what]"
HARI01b_1068b78c	Aria	So while everyone hates the Scholomance... Saints, I hate the Scholomance...	game/script.rpy	2926	Aria "[what]"
HARI01b_56613ba4	Aria	It's bittersweet, you know? The reality is what's for the better isn't what I want.	game/script.rpy	2927	Aria "[what]"
HARI01b_2ebca96f	Aria	Is me graduating going to put more people in danger?	game/script.rpy	2928	Aria "[what]"
HARI01b_958199e0	Aria	I think I already know the answer.	game/script.rpy	2931	Aria "[what]"
HARI01b_c84499ae	Aria	You're sweet. I appreciate you saying that.	game/script.rpy	2935	Aria "[what]"
HARI01b_d17adc46	Aria	Thanks for listening... I get a bit sentimental when I think of home.	game/script.rpy	2938	Aria "[what]"
HARI01b_94d1cdc0	Aria	I miss the mountains, the way the air feels up there. It's... peaceful.	game/script.rpy	2939	Aria "[what]"
HARI01b_fa351b59	Aria	The Summit sort of reminds me of it all. Especially when I'm around the Mage Tree.	game/script.rpy	2940	Aria "[what]"
HARI01b_2458732f	Aria	I can't tell if it's trying to soothe me, or if it's just scared. But I keep going back to it... sort of messed up.	game/script.rpy	2941	Aria "[what]"
HARI01b_f0dba311	Aria	I guess it's my way of coping. Finding comfort in the chaos.	game/script.rpy	2942	Aria "[what]"
HARI01b_20f464d4	Aria	Anyway... I got off topic. Did you want to ask something else?	game/script.rpy	2943	Aria "[what]"
HARI02_b6c9209a	Aria	Manifestation? Well, the first time my magic manifested, no one but pops saw.	game/script.rpy	2951	Aria "[what]"
HARI02_ed7dc665	Aria	I remember sitting in our garden, just a few patches of dry dirt where we grew food in the summer.	game/script.rpy	2952	Aria "[what]"
HARI02_fea2b6c2	Aria	I just... I wished we had more food. That way mum wouldn't have to spend so much time hunting. I pictured it, you know?	game/script.rpy	2953	Aria "[what]"
HARI02_2eca0744	Aria	A garden overgrown with food. Desperate. Eyes closed shut. I almost jumped out of my skin when my pops started shouting.	game/script.rpy	2954	Aria "[what]"
HARI02_24dfb45e	Aria	The garden was spitting vegetables from the ground. Carrots and potatoes shooting up like popcorn from the dirt, soon I couldn't see any dirt at all.	game/script.rpy	2955	Aria "[what]"
HARI02_f1398d12	Aria	Pops just looked at me. I didn't know what he was thinking but I was terrified. I'd lived my whole life thinking an earthquake was my fault and now I was sure I was doing this.	game/script.rpy	2957	Aria "[what]"
HARI02_d001e401	Aria	He grabbed my shoulder gently but I felt like he was pulling me out of the air. He told me never to tell any outsiders I could do this.	game/script.rpy	2958	Aria "[what]"
HARI02_e7f818d2	Aria	The town would accuse us of stealing food. I heard the fear in his voice but I was grinning. I could finally help my family, I wasn't just another mouth to feed.	game/script.rpy	2959	Aria "[what]"
HARI02_ac59b730	Aria	You don't get what I'm trying to say.	game/script.rpy	2962	Aria "[what]"
HARI02_3aeb0838	Aria	Even after all the potions and spells we learned, nobody ever told me I had a river inside me.	game/script.rpy	2963	Aria "[what]"
HARI02_62152be5	Aria	I know I'm just at the beginning of knowing what my new abilities mean, but I'm not afraid of them anymore.	game/script.rpy	2964	Aria "[what]"
HARI02_09268676	Aria	I know it'll be a hard road but I reckon I can control it with the right help.	game/script.rpy	2965	Aria "[what]"
HARI02_f744e1fc	Aria	It's been a long way from the mountains to here. I never felt like I fit in at Scholomance.	game/script.rpy	2970	Aria "[what]"
HARI02_eb26b8a1	Aria	But after that night in the forest, I see it all different.	game/script.rpy	2971	Aria "[what]"
HARI02_8bac2cef	Aria	With the ent I felt another episode coming on, but I didn't panic. It was like...	game/script.rpy	2972	Aria "[what]"
HARI02_2be32633	Aria	this river. Fast. Warm. A river ran from me to him. My mind traveled the river. Then we talked. Not in words, in pictures.	game/script.rpy	2973	Aria "[what]"
HARI02_3aeb0838_1	Aria	Even after all the potions and spells we learned, nobody ever told me I had a river inside me.	game/script.rpy	2974	Aria "[what]"
HARI02_62152be5_1	Aria	I know I'm just at the beginning of knowing what my new abilities mean, but I'm not afraid of them anymore.	game/script.rpy	2975	Aria "[what]"
HARI02_09268676_1	Aria	I know it'll be a hard road but I reckon I can control it with the right help.	game/script.rpy	2976	Aria "[what]"
HARI02_4bd4a90f	Aria	The Scholomance taught me magic can grow life. But I'm starting to see magic is somehow always more than you bargained for.	game/script.rpy	2980	Aria "[what]"
HARI02_f092bd7b	Aria	I want to help people, but I can't stop my magic from hurting them.	game/script.rpy	2981	Aria "[what]"
HARI02_cf324f6f	Aria	I destroyed part of the Archive by just daydreaming -- what would've happened if someone was standing there?	game/script.rpy	2982	Aria "[what]"
HARI02_3a2b7e37	Aria	I hate it.	game/script.rpy	2983	Aria "[what]"
HARI03a_15728a8f	Aria	I still can't believe you found me in the woods. No one has ever done that for me. Your energy is so positive, it'll come back to you, just watch!	game/script.rpy	2992	Aria "[what]"
HARI03b_4ed38fde	Aria	You? Of course I think you're nice. You can be weird too, but that's what I like about you.	game/script.rpy	2999	Aria "[what]"
HARI03b_5f3f8f84	Aria	Let's chat more often. Everyone else is so wrapped up in exams, it gets so lonely.	game/script.rpy	3000	Aria "[what]"
HARI11a_9e1e7863	Aria	I'd hope so! I'd love to be friends with you. It'll be tough doing this week alone.	game/script.rpy	3006	Aria "[what]"
HARI11a_5ef97fef	Aria	I had a good feeling about you. Where I'm from, we rely on each other to get by.	game/script.rpy	3010	Aria "[what]"
HARI11a_434fcf69	Aria	Anytime you need help, I'll do what I can.	game/script.rpy	3011	Aria "[what]"
HARI11a_8f4a68b4	Aria	Ah, no problem. But you don't have to be a stranger, you know.	game/script.rpy	3017	Aria "[what]"
HARI11b_78a28868	Aria	I'm glad you asked... I've been building up to just talking to you about it.	game/script.rpy	3024	Aria "[what]"
HARI11b_21370907	Aria	I just... I want to let you know, you're a real friend. No one's really talking to me after some incidents my magic caused.	game/script.rpy	3025	Aria "[what]"
HARI11b_c08e1f5a	Aria	They think I'm bad luck or something. It's nice to have someone who enjoys chatting with me.	game/script.rpy	3026	Aria "[what]"
HARI11b_3b9c6004	Aria	I'm kind of used to it. In my hometown, some people really looked down on my family.	game/script.rpy	3034	Aria "[what]"
HARI11b_7c6d4817	Aria	Got to keep your head up. Don't let them win. That's what mum says.	game/script.rpy	3035	Aria "[what]"
HARI11b_39406712	Aria	I'm trying my best, I really am.	game/script.rpy	3038	Aria "[what]"
HARI11b_1bba668d	Aria	What I'm really worried about is my exams. What if I lose control and fail?	game/script.rpy	3042	Aria "[what]"
HARI11b_eadc81ed	Aria	You're just trying to make me feel better.	game/script.rpy	3045	Aria "[what]"
HARI11c_cf6a6261	Aria	Why wouldn't we be?	game/script.rpy	3051	Aria "[what]"
HARI12_d97363b7	Aria	If you think life at the Scholomance is tough, what do you reckon is coming after?	game/script.rpy	3056	Aria "[what]"
HARI12_9792e8f1	Aria	I imagine more rules, more Council meetings, reporting to a dozen mages like Eileen.	game/script.rpy	3057	Aria "[what]"
HARI12_3f5d59c0	Aria	It's really not my cup of tea at all. Ties my stomach in knots just thinking on it.	game/script.rpy	3058	Aria "[what]"
HARI12_eb139153	Aria	Want to hear another secret? What I want most in the whole world is to live alone, deep in the forest.	game/script.rpy	3059	Aria "[what]"
HARI12_9fdf16c0	Aria	In a warm cabin, full of herbs and flowers.	game/script.rpy	3060	Aria "[what]"
HARI12_32235069	Aria	Animals coming and going as they like.	game/script.rpy	3061	Aria "[what]"
HARI12_abb09849	Aria	I'm safe. I can't hurt anyone.	game/script.rpy	3062	Aria "[what]"
HARI12_441ba07c	Aria	No one can hurt me.	game/script.rpy	3063	Aria "[what]"
HARI05_27d7133f	Aria	Oh, Melody? I don't know, I'm sure she doesn't like me much because I'm not from the city.	game/script.rpy	3068	Aria "[what]"
HARI05_c9c35d2c	Aria	I think when she's more secure in herself, she'll let herself trust others.	game/script.rpy	3069	Aria "[what]"
HARI05_77e79134	Aria	Back at Scholomance we were in some of the same classes. Mel probably doesn't even remember I was there.	game/script.rpy	3073	Aria "[what]"
HARI05_fb8e7df1	Aria	One time during an atelier, her practice wand broke and she started to cry. I was surprised because she's supposed to be so tough...	game/script.rpy	3074	Aria "[what]"
HARI05_d095b614	Aria	Yea, she had to start the enchantment all over again but there wasn't enough time.	game/script.rpy	3077	Aria "[what]"
HARI05_a43a81ad	Aria	That stuff happens to us all the time, but not to her.	game/script.rpy	3078	Aria "[what]"
HARI05_4571673a	Aria	A bit. We only got minor discipline for stuff like that. She had to use a simpler spell because there was no time left.	game/script.rpy	3082	Aria "[what]"
HARI05_bafceff3	Aria	But it was like her life was crumbling before her eyes.	game/script.rpy	3083	Aria "[what]"
HARI05_55276161	Aria	She's nice enough, but she's not a genuine person. She's always sizing you up, looking for your weakness.	game/script.rpy	3087	Aria "[what]"
HARI05_1e4ddea0	Aria	Mel does it so often that she can't believe other people aren't doing it to her.	game/script.rpy	3088	Aria "[what]"
HARI05_275793e4	Aria	It makes her put up walls.	game/script.rpy	3089	Aria "[what]"
HARI05_f3edcdb5	Aria	I notice a lot of things.	game/script.rpy	3093	Aria "[what]"
HARI05_feeb0b5b	Aria	People think I'm stupid because I wear pretty dresses and have bigger things to worry about than grades.	game/script.rpy	3094	Aria "[what]"
HARI05_efba5846	Aria	Mel lets her facade down around me. She knows I'm not a threat.	game/script.rpy	3095	Aria "[what]"
HARI05_c819936f	Aria	But I can see the cracks. I can see how hard she tries to keep it all together.	game/script.rpy	3096	Aria "[what]"
HARI05_53330551	Aria	It's like she's holding a fragile glass sculpture, and she's terrified of it shattering.	game/script.rpy	3097	Aria "[what]"
HARI06_a0fcec67	Aria	Tao is a sweetheart under all that, I can feel it.	game/script.rpy	3101	Aria "[what]"
HARI06_87b452ef	Aria	It's just that they never put anything above being the best at school.	game/script.rpy	3102	Aria "[what]"
HARI06_eaa16f36	Aria	I know I'll never be the best mage here. But there's more to life than getting the best grades.	game/script.rpy	3103	Aria "[what]"
HARI06_0a49de48	Aria	What about being a good friend that you can rely on?	game/script.rpy	3104	Aria "[what]"
HARI06_13360d5d	Aria	If only they'd keep secrets. Instead, they'd try to use it against you.	game/script.rpy	3105	Aria "[what]"
HARI06_b3f5da5b	Aria	I like Tao but I can't trust them, which makes me sad.	game/script.rpy	3106	Aria "[what]"
HARI07_1b746b29	Aria	Xander? I'd like to get to know him better but he's so quiet.	game/script.rpy	3110	Aria "[what]"
HARI07_fc7da82f	Aria	I tried to offer him some stew one time, but he all but ran from me!	game/script.rpy	3111	Aria "[what]"
HARI07_1d356b4b	Aria	He's moody during exams, I think he's really stressed.	game/script.rpy	3112	Aria "[what]"
HARI07_7cae28c7	Aria	If we were friends I'd tell him that it's not the end of the world if you can't memorize everything.	game/script.rpy	3113	Aria "[what]"
HARI07_00b914b1	Aria	Sometimes you can work around it.	game/script.rpy	3114	Aria "[what]"
HARI08_2088c93d	Aria	Rex never seems happy.	game/script.rpy	3118	Aria "[what]"
HARI08_30103d65	Aria	I feel bad for him, he really seems to hate it here, and no matter how much he rebels they always deal with him.	game/script.rpy	3119	Aria "[what]"
HARI08_829d9728	Aria	I've tried to make friends with him a few times but he won't have it.	game/script.rpy	3120	Aria "[what]"
HARI08_59ddc626	Aria	He reminds me of a mountain goat. A headstrong loner that won't hesitate to charge at you when they're mad.	game/script.rpy	3121	Aria "[what]"
HARI08_4a64638c	Aria	When I have time, I'll make him a fire flower or something. I'm sure he'd feel better.	game/script.rpy	3122	Aria "[what]"
HARI04_a19181f1	Aria	I'm as surprised as anyone the ents like me.	game/script.rpy	3127	Aria "[what]"
HARI04_05be5e3b	Aria	It takes them forever to finish a thought. Really stubborn, the lot of them.	game/script.rpy	3130	Aria "[what]"
HARI04_17f09298	Aria	It's the other way around, more like. The ent that held me was 645 years old.	game/script.rpy	3133	Aria "[what]"
HARI04_af8e93e6	Aria	To him we're just babies. We'll be gone in the blink of an eye. Got the feeling he was sorry for me.	game/script.rpy	3134	Aria "[what]"
HARI04_fa2312f4	Aria	He asked me who I was, chatting to him like that.	game/script.rpy	3138	Aria "[what]"
HARI04_2aa8153c	Aria	Erm, I said my name. Then I asked him his name.	game/script.rpy	3141	Aria "[what]"
HARI04_7486a5d3	Aria	His name was very, very long, too long. I only remember how it started, so I call him Nert in my head.	game/script.rpy	3142	Aria "[what]"
HARI04_8269d0df	Aria	Hm, it felt natural to me. Living things always have something to say.	game/script.rpy	3146	Aria "[what]"
HARI04_8a1975e4	Aria	Something to ask Nert when I see him next.	game/script.rpy	3147	Aria "[what]"
HARI09_b8254aac	Aria	I don't know why Eileen dislikes me so much.	game/script.rpy	3152	Aria "[what]"
HARI09_abc698e7	Aria	She says I need to stop the daydreaming.	game/script.rpy	3153	Aria "[what]"
HARI09_622370b3	Aria	It's not fair, I never set out to hurt anyone.	game/script.rpy	3154	Aria "[what]"
HARI09_997e071c	Aria	Doesn't intention matter to her?	game/script.rpy	3155	Aria "[what]"
HARI09_a2ecc193	Aria	She told me that I was a weak mage and would get someone killed one day. I can feel her watching me and it makes me really anxious.	game/script.rpy	3157	Aria "[what]"
HARI10_f55a0f6b	Aria	You know, Alice collected me from home and took me to the Scholomance.	game/script.rpy	3162	Aria "[what]"
HARI10_e34cfec9	Aria	I know mum and pops wanted to ask her if they'd ever see me again.	game/script.rpy	3163	Aria "[what]"
HARI10_28f2d442	Aria	I don't remember what we talked about on our way to the school. She was chatting away, and I just nodded.	game/script.rpy	3164	Aria "[what]"
HARI10_21f4879a	Aria	I was so scared.	game/script.rpy	3165	Aria "[what]"
HARI10_cfd3b7c3	Aria	First time away from home and all that. But she made me feel like magic was the biggest opportunity of my life.	game/script.rpy	3166	Aria "[what]"
HARI10_74f9bd64	Aria	She told me not to be ashamed.	game/script.rpy	3167	Aria "[what]"
HARI10_4124848e	Aria	I wouldn't have tried so hard to be a good mage if it wasn't for Alice.	game/script.rpy	3168	Aria "[what]"
HARI10_22283225	Aria	I don't know what makes her so kind but I'm grateful for it. I've always felt like she's been on my side.	game/script.rpy	3169	Aria "[what]"
HARI14_9bcce4f4	Aria	Before you found me, I just... wandered.	game/script.rpy	3173	Aria "[what]"
HARI14_406009c7	Aria	I wasn't using the light spell anymore. Stupid, maybe, but I wanted the dark.	game/script.rpy	3174	Aria "[what]"
HARI14_bfa3b1c3	Aria	I wasn't going back to the Summit so it didn't matter.	game/script.rpy	3175	Aria "[what]"
HARI14_119c49ba	Aria	I don't know how much time passed. A voice in my gut said the forest was watching me to see what I'd do.	game/script.rpy	3176	Aria "[what]"
HARI14_b6ae1c65	Aria	Animal noises everywhere and...	game/script.rpy	3177	Aria "[what]"
HARI14_22f9640f	Aria	other sounds I didn't know. When I couldn't run any more, I sat down in a patch of brush.	game/script.rpy	3178	Aria "[what]"
HARI14_82a42eb1	Aria	Not right away. I lay my head down and let myself drift.	game/script.rpy	3181	Aria "[what]"
HARI14_40f7cd4c	Aria	My whole body was hot and the flowers started to bloom from my head down to my toes.	game/script.rpy	3182	Aria "[what]"
HARI14_1e01d03d	Aria	Ones I'd never seen before. That's when he started to grumble.	game/script.rpy	3183	Aria "[what]"
HARI14_dbfcd424	Aria	Scared enough. I'd still rather be there than trapped at the Summit.	game/script.rpy	3186	Aria "[what]"
HARI14_79f8497e	Aria	My heart was beating out of my chest, though.	game/script.rpy	3187	Aria "[what]"
HARI14_fec89938	Aria	The Ent lifted me up. I knew what his intentions were.	game/script.rpy	3190	Aria "[what]"
HARI14_c4dd28b7	Aria	He just wanted to meet me. It was like he was holding my magic, and my magic was holding me.	game/script.rpy	3191	Aria "[what]"
HARI14_d68e25da	Aria	I began to see what my power could be.	game/script.rpy	3192	Aria "[what]"
HARI17_468ef322	Aria	He's the best part of this place. At first I was afraid of him, either he'd aggravate my... condition… or I'd hurt him somehow.	game/script.rpy	3196	Aria "[what]"
HARI17_9bc2a570	Aria	But he makes me so calm. I feel almost like myself again.	game/script.rpy	3197	Aria "[what]"
HARI17_cd1ed7d4	Aria	He's a very special being. I feel he's been enchanted, but it's more than that.	game/script.rpy	3198	Aria "[what]"
HARI17_c664d953	Aria	Oh yes. If I ever get out of this place, I'd love to learn spells that can make trees so... human.	game/script.rpy	3203	Aria "[what]"
HARI16_b7879fbc	Aria	The others are scared of the forest, I can tell. It's nicer than anywhere in the Summit.	game/script.rpy	3207	Aria "[what]"
HARI16_13c5951c	Aria	I grew up watching all kinds of animals in the woods.	game/script.rpy	3208	Aria "[what]"
HARI16_e8fec5f5	Aria	The thing with animals is that they're never stressed, never in a hurry, they take their time...	game/script.rpy	3209	Aria "[what]"
HARI16_dcba5b4b	Aria	But if you threaten their territory, they are fierce protectors. I know it's a funny thing to say but I look up to them.	game/script.rpy	3210	Aria "[what]"
HARI16_1c350264	Aria	Look at the trees.	game/script.rpy	3211	Aria "[what]"
HARI16_994f30ce	Aria	The forest has never been touched as long as the Summit's been here.	game/script.rpy	3212	Aria "[what]"
HARI16_28433c06	Aria	You got to wonder what creatures live in woods as old as these.	game/script.rpy	3213	Aria "[what]"
HARI15_16a18a75	Aria	Everyone here wants magical power more than anything. But if you can be blessed with magic, can't you be cursed too?	game/script.rpy	3218	Aria "[what]"
HARI15_8514dcba	Aria	The town elders told my mum I'd be born sick because my pops was a different religion than her.	game/script.rpy	3219	Aria "[what]"
HARI15_447eba7d	Aria	They tell me I'm not working hard enough. I'm doing everything I can.	game/script.rpy	3222	Aria "[what]"
HARI15_64a5f021	Aria	Maybe I'm not mage material. But I can't go home like this, either.	game/script.rpy	3223	Aria "[what]"
HARI15_75bbae59	Aria	The day I was born, an earthquake leveled several houses in town and they said it was my fault.	game/script.rpy	3226	Aria "[what]"
HARI15_01a172f2	Aria	And now, my magic is out of control. Aren't I sick after all?	game/script.rpy	3227	Aria "[what]"
HARI15_d56a3b06	Aria	I know I needed to go to the Scholomance to learn how to handle my magic.	game/script.rpy	3230	Aria "[what]"
HARI15_eed80a64	Aria	I'm afraid my magic is stronger than me. It'll do something worse than an earthquake.	game/script.rpy	3231	Aria "[what]"
HARI15_8ed894bc	Aria	Something really, really, bad.	game/script.rpy	3232	Aria "[what]"
HARI18a_3f47f877	Aria	It's all different since the forest.	game/script.rpy	3236	Aria "[what]"
HARI18a_2dfe44b9	Aria	I get now I'm just part of a big mystery that's happening around us all the time.	game/script.rpy	3237	Aria "[what]"
HARI18a_9e5a7214	Aria	I'm not good or evil. It's my choices that make the world better or worse. If I deal with my fear, my magic will help me find my place.	game/script.rpy	3238	Aria "[what]"
HARI18a_f26dd749	Aria	I reckon I'm starting to get what it means to be a mage.	game/script.rpy	3239	Aria "[what]"
HARI18b_9201bf97	Aria	Scared and confused. I can't sort it out, if I'm honest.	game/script.rpy	3243	Aria "[what]"
HARI18b_016ab5a2	Aria	I can't fix my magic. And I don't see what place a broken mage has in this world.	game/script.rpy	3244	Aria "[what]"
taohub_main_9b34b0cf	Tao	What did you want to discuss?	game/script.rpy	3269	Tao "[what]"
taohub_main_7e396534	Tao	You're going? Hmm.	game/script.rpy	3384	Tao "[what]"
taohub_main_8faa2b7a	Tao	Go ahead.	game/script.rpy	3387	Tao "[what]"
taohub_main_81ffe02b	Tao	Goodbye.	game/script.rpy	3390	Tao "[what]"
taohub_main_84da79d7	Tao	...	game/script.rpy	3393	Tao "[what]"
HTAO014_72b04d88	Tao	Botany? Just cut things up. It's all about being optimal.	game/script.rpy	3423	Tao "[what]"
HTAO014_beeadd08	Tao	There should be a recipe book somewhere in your things that help you with that sort of thing. If not, perhaps check the archive.	game/script.rpy	3424	Tao "[what]"
HTAO014_b1639e68	Tao	Either way, do you mind?	game/script.rpy	3425	Tao "[what]"
HTAO13_56dae58b	Tao	Oh... I cannot help you there.	game/script.rpy	3430	Tao "[what]"
HTAO13_7b6efb85	Tao	Artificing isn't really my forte, I just have a selection prepared and hope that'll get me the grade I need.	game/script.rpy	3431	Tao "[what]"
HTAO13_be3fa090	Tao	One of the others should know better... perhaps Rex -- as... ridiculous as he is, he has a knack for tinkering.	game/script.rpy	3432	Tao "[what]"
HTAO12a_70473192	Tao	You should've learned how to do this years ago... that's what the Scholomance was for.	game/script.rpy	3436	Tao "[what]"
HTAO12a_781fe3ec	Tao	But I suppose I'll help you. Here, this is a simple, but solid recipe. Just follow it.	game/script.rpy	3437	Tao "[what]"
HTAO12a_cf4303e9	Tao	I can't help you during the exam, though, you know? I don't want to fail due to misconduct or something dubious like that.	game/script.rpy	3438	Tao "[what]"
HTAO12b_9b3e36aa	Tao	Why are you wasting my time? What, do you expect me to teach you so you can pass your exam?	game/script.rpy	3442	Tao "[what]"
HTAO12b_170d6942	Tao	Find someone else, I have my own troubles to focus on.	game/script.rpy	3443	Tao "[what]"
HTAO01a_c728f529	Tao	You really want to know more about me?	game/script.rpy	3447	Tao "[what]"
HTAO01a_bd6d3f92	Tao	Really? I've not had that interesting a life.	game/script.rpy	3448	Tao "[what]"
HTAO01a_365ca973	Tao	I grew up in the northern part of Viordia but my father moved us to the capital because he got a promotion at work.	game/script.rpy	3454	Tao "[what]"
HTAO01a_806f633e	Tao	Before that he travelled around the continent similar to Eileen and Alice, making sure that all of us mages are in line and everything is 'up to standard'.	game/script.rpy	3455	Tao "[what]"
HTAO01a_11a14bcb	Tao	Moving was an ordeal. I had a solid set of good friends I'll probably never see again, not the sort I competed with, just the sort who supported and knew me.	game/script.rpy	3456	Tao "[what]"
HTAO01a_8c60ab98	Tao	Settling in a large city wasn't the best and then just as soon as I made new friends I had to move again because my magic manifested.	game/script.rpy	3457	Tao "[what]"
HTAO01a_8b702b0a	Tao	I couldn't sit down without causing a chill, nor could I touch anything I didn't want ice crystals to destroy.	game/script.rpy	3458	Tao "[what]"
HTAO01a_ea2dfb1a	Tao	I feel as though I'm ranting here but to sum it up my life was mostly boring, if anything I'm excited to get out and finally settle somewhere.	game/script.rpy	3460	Tao "[what]"
HTAO01a_213e32e9	Tao	It'd be nice to end up somewhere close to my parents, though.	game/script.rpy	3461	Tao "[what]"
HTAO01b_036e496e	Tao	My past? Why? What's the point of wasting my time learning anything about me?	game/script.rpy	3468	Tao "[what]"
HTAO01b_45109aa2	Tao	Really?	game/script.rpy	3478	Tao "[what]"
HTAO01b_b48a26a6	Tao	Fine... I had a boring upbringing, my father's also a mage, which was nice I suppose.	game/script.rpy	3486	Tao "[what]"
HTAO01b_fb82bd7f	Tao	It meant that when my magic manifested it wasn't as if I had no one to lean on.	game/script.rpy	3487	Tao "[what]"
HTAO01b_a229ae25	Tao	Nevertheless, why are you asking such personal questions? {i}Shoo{/i}. Surely, you have other things on your mind.	game/script.rpy	3488	Tao "[what]"
HTAO02_3f851283	Tao	Why would you want to know about how my magic manifested? What do you get out of that?	game/script.rpy	3494	Tao "[what]"
HTAO02_6e8b7368	Tao	Isn't it sort of an embarrassing ordeal for us? I'm sure more than a few mages caused a disturbance the first time their magic decided to materialise.	game/script.rpy	3495	Tao "[what]"
HTAO02_8f76bb06	Tao	Exactly, so why should I talk to you about it? {i}Shoo{/i}. Go away.	game/script.rpy	3501	Tao "[what]"
HTAO02_a14b0f04	Tao	Surprising. Uhh, I suppose when it manifested it was essentially just water magic.	game/script.rpy	3506	Tao "[what]"
HTAO02_d673cd2a	Tao	I ruined my parents wallpaper by making it rain in our kitchen.	game/script.rpy	3507	Tao "[what]"
HTAO02_b32ca1e7	Tao	My mother was furious, she thought one of my father's enchantments was being odd but when she shooed me out so she could clean up the same thing happened in our dining room.	game/script.rpy	3508	Tao "[what]"
HTAO02_c1e64818	Tao	After a few days of chaos the water started freezing, which caused a whole new set of problems I'm sure you understand.	game/script.rpy	3509	Tao "[what]"
HTAO02_9bfc45ff	Tao	Not as embarrassing as most, but still a bit of a nuisance. I kept having blips of issues like that until I was funnelled into the Scholomance like the rest of you.	game/script.rpy	3510	Tao "[what]"
HTAO02_2d3a3f01	Tao	Well... I suppose other's didn't have a mage father, as that part is rare.	game/script.rpy	3512	Tao "[what]"
HTAO02_419a360c	Tao	When my father got back he tried to keep me calm enough that he could handle my magic, teach me himself, that sort of thing.	game/script.rpy	3513	Tao "[what]"
HTAO02_fab3b043	Tao	Sadly, his magic is completely different from mine and hiding something like a mage in your family would almost certainly have gotten him arrested.	game/script.rpy	3514	Tao "[what]"
HTAO02_7c26f1cd	Tao	So after a few horrid lessons of him trying to teach me how to use a type of magic completely opposite from his, he got Alice involved, who sent me to the Scholomance.	game/script.rpy	3515	Tao "[what]"
HTAO02_5ebfbe59	Tao	I think about that very often.	game/script.rpy	3516	Tao "[what]"
HTAO02_aa7072ec	Tao	My father didn't really seem to want me to go to the Scholomance, I suppose he was embarrassed that I wouldn't do as well as him but I suppose that shame was outweighed by his inability to help me.	game/script.rpy	3517	Tao "[what]"
HTAO02_20700987	Tao	By the time I'd left, half the living room needed skates to navigate and we hadn't had working water in a while as the pipes were frozen. My poor mother.	game/script.rpy	3518	Tao "[what]"
HTAO02_7808aba3	Tao	Isn't it for everyone?	game/script.rpy	3521	Tao "[what]"
HTAO02_bc45fbf7	Tao	Sated, or do you also want to know what my first words were?	game/script.rpy	3524	Tao "[what]"
HTAO02_39378dd7	Narrator	Tao shoots you a glare that reminds you, oddly enough, of Eileen's scowl. You should leave them be.	game/script.rpy	3530	Narrator "[what]"
HTAO03a_b8aaa89e	Tao	I don't like her, nor do I trust her. The temptation to do anything to be the best was intense in me, and it took its toll. It still does.	game/script.rpy	3535	Tao "[what]"
HTAO03a_b27103a6	Tao	I can say that behind that pretty face, there's probably something devious going on. You don't get to the top of the mountain without crushing a few ants.	game/script.rpy	3536	Tao "[what]"
HTAO03a_543c31b6	Tao	I know what it takes to get where she is, trust me, there's something amiss with her.	game/script.rpy	3537	Tao "[what]"
HTAO03b_a32cd529	Tao	I can't say I detest Melody but I certainly don't like her.	game/script.rpy	3541	Tao "[what]"
HTAO03b_a92a9aed	Tao	We've been academic rivals since our first days in the Scholomance, and while I study, study, study and work for those top marks, she just seems to breeze through it all.	game/script.rpy	3542	Tao "[what]"
HTAO03b_faca6872	Tao	There's always a cost to academic achievement and she's yet to pay it.	game/script.rpy	3543	Tao "[what]"
HTAO03b_76da14e2	Tao	I was the top student in our first year, with her coming second, and she was top in the third year with me coming second, the trend kept fluctuating like that.	game/script.rpy	3544	Tao "[what]"
HTAO03b_dce17c2e	Tao	I will beat her, cementing myself as the top student of our year. I don't care what stunts she pulls, I'm ready for it.	game/script.rpy	3545	Tao "[what]"
HTAO04a_5fe108bd	Tao	I feel rather guilty about Rex. He was friendly to me, especially after seeing I was isolated.	game/script.rpy	3550	Tao "[what]"
HTAO04a_a5d79064	Tao	I thought we could be friendly, so I taught him a somewhat...	game/script.rpy	3551	Tao "[what]"
HTAO04a_cfb87fd2	Tao	...complex spell I found in the restricted area of the Great Library in the Scholomance... he tried it, but it backfired.	game/script.rpy	3552	Tao "[what]"
HTAO04a_337c6837	Tao	He got in trouble with the tutors.	game/script.rpy	3553	Tao "[what]"
HTAO04a_c9ab6a77	Tao	They questioned where he learned that spell, obviously he said that I taught him it...	game/script.rpy	3554	Tao "[what]"
HTAO04a_35d25ff1	Tao	I did, but I didn't want to get in trouble so I denied it and he got in more trouble for not only 'lying' but also accessing a restricted area of the library.	game/script.rpy	3555	Tao "[what]"
HTAO04a_68e38825	Tao	The more advanced the knowledge I possess, the higher the grade. That was my logic, I suppose.	game/script.rpy	3558	Tao "[what]"
HTAO04a_8b9e33b4	Tao	He's justified to. In a... sort of odd way, it's a good thing, though.	game/script.rpy	3565	Tao "[what]"
HTAO04a_738b91b2	Tao	The man seems on the path that'll end up with Eileen hunting him down. I've seen less volatile things in the alchemy lab.	game/script.rpy	3566	Tao "[what]"
HTAO04a_cc68f16a	Tao	He's one bad day away from blowing up the school. I don't think our friendship not blossoming caused that. 	game/script.rpy	3567	Tao "[what]"
HTAO04b_4d627798	Tao	Rex and I aren't on good terms, I don't have much to say about him so don't waste my time.	game/script.rpy	3577	Tao "[what]"
HTAO04b_1d747768	Tao	He tried to sabotage one of my projects. When I saw that he would be in our graduation class I devised a spell to stop tampering specifically for him.	game/script.rpy	3580	Tao "[what]"
HTAO04b_90c30439	Tao	it seems he didn't like that.	game/script.rpy	3581	Tao "[what]"
HTAO05a_6b4b2db2	Tao	Truly I don't mind Aria. I've never really spoken to her, but I've noticed her from afar.	game/script.rpy	3593	Tao "[what]"
HTAO05a_d4fbfa9c	Tao	She's powerful, I'm sure in terms of raw power she rivals some more mature mages like Eileen and Alice.	game/script.rpy	3594	Tao "[what]"
HTAO05a_718a1cd6	Tao	I believe she's a little ditzy to really navigate that sort of power. I had similar issues when my power manifested.	game/script.rpy	3595	Tao "[what]"
HTAO05a_db49a1d6	Tao	I've always been a little... well, not jealous exactly, perhaps a better word is envious... of how quickly people tend to like Aria.	game/script.rpy	3596	Tao "[what]"
HTAO05a_54136c16	Tao	She has this odd worldview about her, she's capable of seeing positives anywhere she goes... she seems uncomplicated, but I've seen when that facade breaks.	game/script.rpy	3597	Tao "[what]"
HTAO05a_0fbbd631	Tao	It's hard to trust someone who is all about the bright side. You wonder if they're purposely ignoring discomforts or whether they're simply unphased by them.	game/script.rpy	3598	Tao "[what]"
HTAO05a_384d1581	Tao	Either way, I have nothing against Aria, but I think it's a bit too close to graduation to start any conversation.	game/script.rpy	3599	Tao "[what]"
HTAO05b_a90aa4c7	Tao	You want to know what I think of Aria… She's ditsy but powerful, I'll beat her in grades but if it came to a fight she'd mop the floor with everyone here other than Eileen, that much I'm sure of.	game/script.rpy	3606	Tao "[what]"
HTAO05b_09bb5935	Tao	If either of them have a braincell between them, they'd agree with me. Aria is a once in a lifetime mage in raw power.	game/script.rpy	3609	Tao "[what]"
HTAO05b_eb832ad1	Tao	Half of the instructors feared her at the Scholomance. I'd imagine Eileen is only here in order to have something to counteract her if she fell of the deep end.	game/script.rpy	3610	Tao "[what]"
HTAO05b_fcc184d1	Tao	That's what I think of her. Can I go back to my work now?	game/script.rpy	3611	Tao "[what]"
HTAO08a_42e5d33d	Tao	I don't want to talk about her.	game/script.rpy	3618	Tao "[what]"
HTAO08a_ebd292af	Tao	What, did she send you here?	game/script.rpy	3619	Tao "[what]"
HTAO08a_a307a09a	Tao	Leave me alone. Please.	game/script.rpy	3620	Tao "[what]"
HTAO08b_22d98132	Tao	With everything that went on, I think Alice has everyone's best interest at heart.	game/script.rpy	3626	Tao "[what]"
HTAO08b_a3d9463d	Tao	Despite my not liking it, I'm sure the advice she gave me is out of a place of experience.	game/script.rpy	3627	Tao "[what]"
HTAO08b_7192178b	Tao	I was taking everything too far and close to breaking down. I still think she's overbearing, but I have a bit more respect for her.	game/script.rpy	3628	Tao "[what]"
HTAO08c_ebd6bbd4	Tao	Alice seems nice. I always found her dolls rather creepy, though.	game/script.rpy	3634	Tao "[what]"
HTAO08c_4e91b80c	Tao	It took me a long time to understand that she merged conjuration with Geomancy in order to create them.	game/script.rpy	3635	Tao "[what]"
HTAO08c_4f814876	Tao	I wonder why they're so specifically porcelain.	game/script.rpy	3636	Tao "[what]"
HTAO08c_8406d241	Tao	Is it a wealth statement? Or a magical restriction...	game/script.rpy	3637	Tao "[what]"
HTAO06a_b1a19a2c	Tao	I'd rather not get into what happened between Xander and I. It's not relevant. Let's just say we fell out and leave it there.	game/script.rpy	3643	Tao "[what]"
HTAO06b_8d5cddfa	Tao	I'd rather not talk about Xander. Everyone knows we were friends at one point, but friends drift, especially when the difference between us is so vast.	game/script.rpy	3650	Tao "[what]"
HTAO06b_05cd94d1	Tao	There comes a point where you have to cut yourself off from the slackers in order to focus on your own work.	game/script.rpy	3651	Tao "[what]"
HTAO06b_803349cf	Tao	It was probably for the best, people like him are intellect pits, anything smart around him catches the dumbness curse he's clearly afflicted with...	game/script.rpy	3652	Tao "[what]"
HTAO11a_e27cfbbd	Tao	If I'm being candid with you, I don't enjoy talking about my father.	game/script.rpy	3659	Tao "[what]"
HTAO11a_bb38f92e	Tao	In most cases, the first thing anyone notable talks about with me is my father. It instils a lot of pressure on me.	game/script.rpy	3660	Tao "[what]"
HTAO11a_c3683e28	Tao	I don't know of any mages who have mage children, it being a seemingly random trait means that I had a very unique experience as a teen, but it also means I never really got to define my own path.	game/script.rpy	3661	Tao "[what]"
HTAO11a_b03ccb51	Tao	I don't have an excuse to not be as competent as him, after all, he's my blood so I should be able to be equal if not better than him.	game/script.rpy	3662	Tao "[what]"
HTAO11a_242828b0	Tao	Plus, and please don't tell anyone this, I don't really know my father all too well, his job has always meant he's far from me.	game/script.rpy	3663	Tao "[what]"
HTAO11a_bf321bd6	Tao	When I was a child I lived only with my mother as his job meant he travelled around the country similar to what Eileen and Alice do.	game/script.rpy	3664	Tao "[what]"
HTAO11a_933b11aa	Tao	He'd be back every few months, but it's not like I really connected with him during that time.	game/script.rpy	3665	Tao "[what]"
HTAO11a_c4bc2e2f	Tao	I had my own worries, school, grades, friends... all things I never relied on him for.	game/script.rpy	3666	Tao "[what]"
HTAO11a_97a29d7c	Tao	When my father got promoted I initially believed we were being blessed, he felt more like a myth than a man.	game/script.rpy	3667	Tao "[what]"
HTAO11a_98b87026	Tao	I wanted to actually understand where I came from. My mother and I have this complicated...	game/script.rpy	3668	Tao "[what]"
HTAO11a_9b60b2f5	Tao	....attitude.	game/script.rpy	3669	Tao "[what]"
HTAO11a_735c6f99	Tao	She expects the best of me, both because she's a recognized academic, but also because of who my father is.	game/script.rpy	3670	Tao "[what]"
HTAO11a_982ebd6f	Tao	Thus, I spent a lot of my time trying to impress this man who I never really saw, and I always managed it.	game/script.rpy	3671	Tao "[what]"
HTAO11a_6490b153	Tao	He'd come back, see my grades, tell my mother how well I was doing, and we'd celebrate.	game/script.rpy	3672	Tao "[what]"
HTAO11a_5357ab5b	Tao	So, when he got promoted it meant he'd be spending far more time with us. We had to move, which was horrible, but at least he'd be home in the evenings.	game/script.rpy	3673	Tao "[what]"
HTAO11a_6708d3dd	Tao	I barely got to spend any time with him though because a few weeks after we moved into this big new house my magic started to manifest itself.	game/script.rpy	3674	Tao "[what]"
HTAO11a_542b8f0a	Tao	I think I was in denial at first. My drinking glass froze and I fully believed that perhaps a chill did it.	game/script.rpy	3675	Tao "[what]"
HTAO11a_f6a89ab0	Tao	I kept hiding it, not really understanding what was happening to me because it felt like an impossibility. But sadly, no, I was a mage.	game/script.rpy	3676	Tao "[what]"
HTAO11a_3dd88c2b	Tao	Of course, I didn't know what would happen.	game/script.rpy	3677	Tao "[what]"
HTAO11a_4075e7f3	Tao	My father got home to wet walls and a frozen kitchen floor and instead of yelling or exclaiming or having any sort of reaction he just calmly tried to fix it.	game/script.rpy	3678	Tao "[what]"
HTAO11a_b22432ac	Tao	I expected to be shuttled off to the Scholomance, which I imagined to be this prestigious school where I'd excel, but instead he...	game/script.rpy	3679	Tao "[what]"
HTAO11a_6448140f	Tao	...please don't tell anyone this, but he tried to hide it, bury it, help me control any power I had so that it wouldn't see the light of day.	game/script.rpy	3680	Tao "[what]"
HTAO11a_a8eba6e9	Tao	I thought it was because I was such a disappointment. I'd ruined this beautiful house, I'd ruined his reputation, and I was presenting myself as an obstacle to his career.	game/script.rpy	3681	Tao "[what]"
HTAO11a_8cb1508b	Tao	It was unfathomable, really.	game/script.rpy	3682	Tao "[what]"
HTAO11a_d9d03018	Tao	He never left my side, he took what time he could off work so he could watch me to make sure I wasn't destroying anything.	game/script.rpy	3683	Tao "[what]"
HTAO11a_e8e959f5	Tao	Eventually, the inconvenience got too much and he brought Alice into my room, who explained what was going to happen for the next seven years of my life.	game/script.rpy	3684	Tao "[what]"
HTAO11a_836114d0	Tao	I can still remember her sitting next to me on a perpetually cold chair and telling me that I {i}had{/i} to go to the Scholomance, {i}all mages{/i} do.	game/script.rpy	3685	Tao "[what]"
HTAO11a_b1ee28a9	Tao	I was happy to. School was something I was good at, school was something I could adapt to.	game/script.rpy	3686	Tao "[what]"
HTAO11a_3cacbf81	Tao	Obviously, getting there was horrid, and being there for seven years was also horrid, but at least I wasn't living in a house of people who I knew would be disappointed in me.	game/script.rpy	3687	Tao "[what]"
HTAO11a_b72958b9	Tao	However, that's also where I changed.	game/script.rpy	3688	Tao "[what]"
HTAO11a_5fde3bc8	Tao	I had this idea in my mind that if I immerged from the depths of that school without being as prestigious and as successful as my father, I would've been a failure.	game/script.rpy	3689	Tao "[what]"
HTAO11a_f862977c	Tao	I still feel that pressure. Perhaps it's because we're almost at graduation, but I still have this gut feeling that the moment I see my father something is going to happen.	game/script.rpy	3690	Tao "[what]"
HTAO11a_882e3fa0	Tao	I want nothing more than to make him proud, but I don't know if I'm even a person, forget mage, he'd be proud of.	game/script.rpy	3691	Tao "[what]"
HTAO11a_8954001b	Tao	I'm immerging from the Scholomance with no friends, potentially no top grades, and enough mental breakdowns to put an asylum to shame.	game/script.rpy	3692	Tao "[what]"
HTAO11a_2e0a5209	Tao	Oh.	game/script.rpy	3695	Tao "[what]"
HTAO11a_f440cb83	Narrator	Tao looks at you, and for a brief moment, smiles a wide, grateful smile.	game/script.rpy	3696	Narrator "[what]"
HTAO11a_43c44cc6	Tao	That means the world to me, really. Thank you.	game/script.rpy	3697	Tao "[what]"
HTAO11a_1fbca9c7	Tao	What will be, will be.	game/script.rpy	3700	Tao "[what]"
HTAO11a_845c21e5	Tao	It's a new start. A fresh start. I'm just glad I learned something from those seven years.	game/script.rpy	3701	Tao "[what]"
HTAO11a_84da79d7	Tao	...	game/script.rpy	3702	Tao "[what]"
HTAO11a_37db9e67	Tao	Ah, that got a bit dark, didn't it? I'm sure you have your own pressures, but those are mine.	game/script.rpy	3703	Tao "[what]"
HTAO11a_1468e58b	Tao	After we're out of this place, perhaps we'll have a few moments of solace to make all this seem inconsequential.	game/script.rpy	3704	Tao "[what]"
HTAO11a_5f9b62bf	Tao	Nevertheless, don't let me keep you. I'm certain you have some last minute revision or planning you want to do.	game/script.rpy	3706	Tao "[what]"
HTAO11b_85ecf025	Tao	What's there to know? My father works as something akin to a diplomat for Mages.	game/script.rpy	3714	Tao "[what]"
HTAO11b_6882f383	Tao	He's above Eileen and Alice in authority, and known well enough among mages.	game/script.rpy	3715	Tao "[what]"
HTAO11b_b4b59304	Tao	We get along, I suppose.	game/script.rpy	3716	Tao "[what]"
HTAO09_e6e1794b	Tao	My father told me he grew up scared of Eileen, she's sort of legendary among mages. I didn't expect her to be as... mean, as she is.	game/script.rpy	3723	Tao "[what]"
HTAO09_30133df9	Tao	There is really nothing that pleases her.	game/script.rpy	3724	Tao "[what]"
HTAO10_255d42cb	Tao	I suppose other than the proctors, I'm the most knowledgeable about that sort of thing... My father does work in that sector.	game/script.rpy	3730	Tao "[what]"
HTAO10_9a8e836b	Tao	From what I understand, the Mage Council dictates the jurisdiction and justification of mages.	game/script.rpy	3732	Tao "[what]"

HTAO10_c94ed4d6	Tao	Despite us being more powerful than a regular person, we don't exactly have numbers on our side and having supernatural abilities doesn't always mean we're accepted.	game/script.rpy	3736	Tao "[what]"
HTAO10_dbfd9084	Tao	I suppose having a body of mages watching over us is better than a regular government.	game/script.rpy	3737	Tao "[what]"

rexhub_main_8d0ec500	Rex	Hmm.	game/script.rpy	3928	Rex "[what]"
rexhub_main_ba75f702	Rex	Bye.	game/script.rpy	3931	Rex "[what]"
HREX02a_37d64bdc	Rex	All family is, is trouble and baggage. Do yourself a favour and don't pry.	game/script.rpy	3952	Rex "[what]"
HREX02b_c6a771ff	Rex	My family, heh? Let's see… dad didn't do shit for me. My ma shipped me off to Scholomance as soon as she could.	game/script.rpy	3959	Rex "[what]"
HREX02b_9b483d43	Rex	She was a clockmaker. Pendulum clocks. Ran the shop herself and never really had time for me, so I was on my own a lot. Sometimes I wish she had taught me clockmaking.	game/script.rpy	3962	Rex "[what]"
HREX02b_0bbc3ec9	Rex	She probably wanted to. But when I was old enough to learn, my magic manifested. Ma never looked at me the same after that.	game/script.rpy	3965	Rex "[what]"
HREX02b_8f17243e	Rex	She was scared of me, of what I'd do. Next thing I knew… Scholomance. I swear everything's just been a blur since. Anyway, let's move on.	game/script.rpy	3966	Rex "[what]"
HREX02b_f96af759	Rex	Not much to say. He fancied himself some sort of scholar, but whatever talent he had, he drank away. Taught me to fight by smacking me around.	game/script.rpy	3972	Rex "[what]"
HREX02b_be3863b6	Rex	That's the only thing he taught me.	game/script.rpy	3973	Rex "[what]"
HREX02b_2700cb9d	Rex	What does he think of your magic?	game/script.rpy	3974	Rex "[what]"
HREX02b_70a8d6ba	Rex	I don't know and don't care.	game/script.rpy	3975	Rex "[what]"
HREX01_1b8b4c29	Rex	Course I can.	game/script.rpy	3981	Rex "[what]"
HREX01_3cf2e584	Rex	You thought I wouldn't share tips? I'm not like Melody or Tao, who will do anything for top marks.	game/script.rpy	3988	Rex "[what]"
HREX01_3b2aeaaa	Rex	They're nothing but a couple of drudges for the school, and they don't even know it. Pathetic.	game/script.rpy	3989	Rex "[what]"
HREX01_952ceb0d	Rex	What do you wanna know?	game/script.rpy	3990	Rex "[what]"
HREX01_c03f6d7d	Rex	Most of it's just the materials. You can't build one of those big city towers with stone alone, you've gotta use reinforced metal...	game/script.rpy	3993	Rex "[what]"
HREX01_905b5bb2	Rex	You've gotta figure out how to make your materials better.	game/script.rpy	3994	Rex "[what]"
HREX01_47db70ce	Rex	Other than that, just make something not shitty.	game/script.rpy	3995	Rex "[what]"
HREX01_5affeeee	Rex	It's not that complicated.	game/script.rpy	3997	Rex "[what]"
HREX01_c5e87093	Rex	Anyway... since I did you a favor. You owe me. All good?	game/script.rpy	3998	Rex "[what]"
HREX01_f0cc5668	Rex	Good.	game/script.rpy	4001	Rex "[what]"
HREX03_9285664e	Rex	My manifestation? Every mage seems to have some sob story around their manifestation. I'm not that kind of guy.	game/script.rpy	4006	Rex "[what]"
HREX03_6913c0f3	Rex	Let's just say, when it happened, it was pointed at the right people. I have no regrets.	game/script.rpy	4013	Rex "[what]"
HREX03_0f5967d6	Rex	That's all you're getting.	game/script.rpy	4014	Rex "[what]"
HREX03_342ca4d9	Rex	My ma was always busy running the clock shop, so I took care of myself most of the time. I did whatever I wanted.	game/script.rpy	4018	Rex "[what]"
HREX03_848c3a8c	Rex	I know it sounds like every kid's dream. But the truth is, when people see you're a little kid, alone, they see a target.	game/script.rpy	4019	Rex "[what]"
HREX03_aee21915	Rex	The boys that ran the street chased me for money from time to time. When they realized I had none, they chased me for fun.	game/script.rpy	4020	Rex "[what]"
HREX03_78d6f4b5	Rex	That one time, I ran into the shop and they followed me in. They threw things around. Demanded cash from ma.	game/script.rpy	4021	Rex "[what]"
HREX03_753080a3	Rex	Every bone in my body was screaming at them to stop. From head to toe, my body felt hot, prickly. My fingers became flames, the flames ripped up my arms.	game/script.rpy	4022	Rex "[what]"
HREX03_0898ea57	Rex	I smelt my hair burning. A firestorm swallowed me up. It was still me at the centre.	game/script.rpy	4023	Rex "[what]"
HREX03_35e30019	Rex	I could still think, still feel. That's why I wasn't scared. My gut told me not to fight it.	game/script.rpy	4024	Rex "[what]"
HREX03_a5ff1c4c	Rex	I don't remember much after that. Ma told me they ran out of the shop, begging the neighbours for water to put out their clothes.	game/script.rpy	4025	Rex "[what]"
HREX03_a37c8d02	Rex	I won't pretend I'm sorry.	game/script.rpy	4026	Rex "[what]"
HREX03_899aab51	Rex	They deserved it.	game/script.rpy	4027	Rex "[what]"
HREX03_94cff0a5	Rex	Damn right. Knew you'd get it.	game/script.rpy	4030	Rex "[what]"
HREX03_21fc8bc8	Rex	Sometimes violence is the answer.	game/script.rpy	4031	Rex "[what]"
HREX03_20be025e	Rex	If my magic wasn't twinged with some demon bullshit, Eileen wouldn't have an issue.	game/script.rpy	4032	Rex "[what]"
HREX03_5c30bfbd	Rex	She uses violence all the time to get what she wants.	game/script.rpy	4033	Rex "[what]"
HREX03_ac713dd8	Rex	Hypocrite.	game/script.rpy	4034	Rex "[what]"
HREX03_940ef7fe	Rex	Yeah. I did.	game/script.rpy	4039	Rex "[what]"
HREX03_c3ff5ee4	Rex	And I'd do it again.	game/script.rpy	4040	Rex "[what]"
HREX12_fbf25792	Rex	I don't need friends, unless youre willing to help me with my plan. Actions over words, as they say. Friends take risks for each other, right?	game/script.rpy	4045	Rex "[what]"
HREX12_c60e65f6	Rex	If you have to ask, you ain't someone I'd be friends with.	game/script.rpy	4048	Rex "[what]"
HREX12_a8f02ab7	Rex	Piss off.	game/script.rpy	4049	Rex "[what]"
HREX12_88cb4264		I knew you weren't like the others. We'll be thick as thieves, you and me.	game/script.rpy	4054	"[what]"
HREX12_385e5387		Thought so. Don't bother me, then. And don't you dare go running to Eileen and Alice.	game/script.rpy	4060	"[what]"
HREX14_de981698	Rex	Statues are a symbol of the Mage Council. They're too high and mighty for something as corrupt as your average mage.	game/script.rpy	4065	Rex "[what]"
HREX14_00b6d1c0	Rex	You know who gets a statue? Hypocrites, liars, and authoritarians. Mages who'll do anything to get to the top.	game/script.rpy	4066	Rex "[what]"
HREX14_a333b1f9	Rex	You'll probably see Melody's statue one day, ha!	game/script.rpy	4067	Rex "[what]"
HREX05_67a48189	Rex	Melody is evil. I know you won't believe me, no one believes that that uptight nerd could be anything but a model mage, but I've seen it.	game/script.rpy	4073	Rex "[what]"
HREX05_10494f2b	Rex	She puts her ambition first.	game/script.rpy	4074	Rex "[what]"
HREX05_c5c7d622	Rex	You all think I'm untrustworthy, well, the face of evil is right over there.	game/script.rpy	4075	Rex "[what]"
HREX06_8f8126e1	Rex	You might feel sorry for Tao, but don't turn your back on them. They're dangerous…obsessed about grades and will throw you under the carriage for a high mark.	game/script.rpy	4081	Rex "[what]"
HREX06_7c960d90	Rex	Mark my words, they'll brown nose all the right people and the doors will open for them. People like that aren't worth my time.	game/script.rpy	4082	Rex "[what]"
HREX08_b3ea3be9	Rex	Honestly, I'm surprised Aria's made it this far. The look in her eyes sometimes. A deer in a forest of wolves.	game/script.rpy	4088	Rex "[what]"
HREX08_ef68d802	Rex	It's kind of her fault. She's such a pushover. I think she hopes they'll come around to her.	game/script.rpy	4089	Rex "[what]"
HREX08_18ee0ab7	Rex	Her magic is something else, though. I've seen her do some wild shit.	game/script.rpy	4090	Rex "[what]"
HREX07_e66c7166	Rex	Xander? Barely know him. I mean we've chatted but he's...	game/script.rpy	4096	Rex "[what]"
HREX07_a5c19f20	Rex	...too much. He's short, quick, and too in your face.	game/script.rpy	4097	Rex "[what]"
HREX07_2fdbe9fd	Rex	I think, underneath it all, he's terrified. I almost feel sorry for the guy, but he's just {i}so{/i} annoying.	game/script.rpy	4098	Rex "[what]"
HREX15_2c3c5818	Rex	I'm going to burn it place down -- it wasn't a university, it was a prison. I shouldn't have been put here just because I got magic.	game/script.rpy	4104	Rex "[what]"
HREX15_86fd7e66	Rex	If the Scholomance disappeared tomorrow the world would be a better place.	game/script.rpy	4105	Rex "[what]"
HREX15_fc4bfb23	Rex	Mages will learn magic in other ways. We don't need the Council or that school, believe me.	game/script.rpy	4108	Rex "[what]"
HREX15_1624d866	Rex	No exams, no ateliers, no punishments. You're finally seeing what things could be like.	game/script.rpy	4111	Rex "[what]"
HREX11a_45dc5746	Rex	Erm, ok, I've never told anyone this before, but I did some portal magic. I know it's forbidden for students.	game/script.rpy	4116	Rex "[what]"
HREX11a_c4b994a0	Rex	We'd done some magic theory on it in class - I just started playing around after hours.	game/script.rpy	4117	Rex "[what]"
HREX11a_5fe973d0	Rex	No bad intentions, honest.	game/script.rpy	4118	Rex "[what]"
HREX11a_a2ec52d2	Rex	Then, once, only for a few moments, a small portal opened up in my room.	game/script.rpy	4119	Rex "[what]"
HREX11a_53685036	Rex	I just about pissed myself.	game/script.rpy	4120	Rex "[what]"
HREX11a_3d554fa9	Rex	But a voice in my head said, look at what you can do.	game/script.rpy	4121	Rex "[what]"
HREX11a_53ef4fc5	Rex	An imp crawled out.	game/script.rpy	4122	Rex "[what]"
HREX11a_4d3c67ad	Rex	A squirmy, nasty thing. Only a baby.	game/script.rpy	4123	Rex "[what]"
HREX11a_27617e46	Rex	I kept it in my room for a couple of days and fed it from the mess hall.	game/script.rpy	4124	Rex "[what]"
HREX11a_c8149a00	Rex	What was I supposed to do, let it go? Anyway, the imp got out one night. Everyone panicked.	game/script.rpy	4125	Rex "[what]"
HREX11a_65be5459	Rex	Eileen caught and killed the poor wretch.	game/script.rpy	4126	Rex "[what]"
HREX11a_d64b0534	Rex	Then she went ballistic on me. The witch looked twice her normal size, screaming that portals were forbidden and I was either dumb or evil for opening one.	game/script.rpy	4127	Rex "[what]"
HREX11a_81da9783	Rex	You know what?	game/script.rpy	4128	Rex "[what]"
HREX11a_aca8c2af	Rex	That damn imp was the one and only time I ever came close to understanding my magic at Scholomance.	game/script.rpy	4129	Rex "[what]"
HREX11a_43789c9f	Rex	It meant something, that I was responsible for it, even if it was an accident.	game/script.rpy	4130	Rex "[what]"
HREX11a_0c18b733	Rex	Eileen ruined it. She deprived me of something big. Something that I can't even explain.	game/script.rpy	4131	Rex "[what]"
HREX11a_82504768	Rex	So, yea, I hold a grudge. Everyone who gave me shit for it can be swallowed by the ground.	game/script.rpy	4132	Rex "[what]"
HREX11b_a137e139	Rex	Eileen is a cruel witch. Period. I'd never trust her. I'd never help her.	game/script.rpy	4137	Rex "[what]"
HREX10_c774c02b	Rex	She's weak. Always going on about everyone's feelings. Trying to be friendly. Maybe she puts it on to get close to us.	game/script.rpy	4141	Rex "[what]"
HREX10_daf20415	Rex	One thing I can't square -- what's someone so nice doing with all those enchanted Dolls? I don't think I want to know why she made them.	game/script.rpy	4142	Rex "[what]"
HREX09a_80e955df	Rex	You're just another keener trying to climb the ranks. So nah, we're not friends.	game/script.rpy	4146	Rex "[what]"
HREX09b_9cd32a8e	Rex	Heh, well, do you want to be? I know it's hard for me to open up. Not used to relying on other people for anything.	game/script.rpy	4150	Rex "[what]"
HREX09b_32754f22	Rex	But it's not so bad, is it? Having someone to plan with, to talk things over with.	game/script.rpy	4151	Rex "[what]"
HREX09b_6dd65966	Rex	Nah, I don't think so. All conformists in the end. I do feel more sorry for Aria and Xander.	game/script.rpy	4155	Rex "[what]"
HREX09b_21130cd7	Rex	They're probably like me, going about their lives, and then -- bam -- they end up in the Scholomance.	game/script.rpy	4156	Rex "[what]"
HREX09b_8d01168e	Rex	Melody and Tao think the school will make their dreams come true. They'll see...	game/script.rpy	4157	Rex "[what]"
HREX09b_f73c6dfe	Rex	They're smart. They'll know one day they got conned.	game/script.rpy	4160	Rex "[what]"
HREX09b_d6e78ec6	Rex	Sure they'll have power and authority, but they'll never be free.	game/script.rpy	4161	Rex "[what]"
HREX09b_cad67ac1	Rex	Not like us.	game/script.rpy	4162	Rex "[what]"
HREX09b_bbfb8712	Rex	There's a lot of magic the Council won't teach us, you know. They have the knowledge, but they keep it for themselves.	game/script.rpy	4168	Rex "[what]"
HREX09b_faed8bbd	Rex	That's why the broken statues will piss them off -- not because we disrupted some ceremony.	game/script.rpy	4169	Rex "[what]"
HREX09c_4251d051	Rex	Course. You had my back. I'm glad I met you.	game/script.rpy	4174	Rex "[what]"
HREX09c_ed3bda84	Rex	Shame we're not gonna see each other much wherever you end up.	game/script.rpy	4175	Rex "[what]"
HREX09d_f8c36c49	Rex	I know it was you who snitched to Eileen and Alice. And to think, for a minute, I thought we could be friends. Get out of my sight.	game/script.rpy	4180	Rex "[what]"
HREX09e_55197780	Rex	I don't really know you. What an weird question.	game/script.rpy	4186	Rex "[what]"
HREX13_a5617ec6	Rex	No chance I'll be let into the Mage Council's inner network. Eileen probably thinks I'll try to burn the place down. Maybe I will.	game/script.rpy	4192	Rex "[what]"
HREX13_ab43e385	Rex	There's nothing for me in there. After the Scholomance, I'll make it on my own terms.	game/script.rpy	4193	Rex "[what]"
HREX13_d9edef8f	Rex	I'll think of something. I always do. I don't care if I have to sleep in a ditch, as long as I'm free.	game/script.rpy	4194	Rex "[what]"
HREX04_d18dd9fb	Rex	Heh, I'm not an anarchist. And I don't hate society. What I do hate is the Mage Council. Just because we manifested magic, they're allowed to run our lives.	game/script.rpy	4198	Rex "[what]"
HREX04_88de6c60	Rex	They tell us how to do magic, where to do it, and why.	game/script.rpy	4199	Rex "[what]"
HREX04_9187d585	Rex	Going to Scholomance ruined my life. I'm stuck in the mousetrap they built. All they've ever done for me is threaten me with punishment if I didn't act right.	game/script.rpy	4200	Rex "[what]"
HREX04_99d246a9	Rex	I'd rather die than be under their thumb forever.	game/script.rpy	4201	Rex "[what]"
HREX04_ad6b8117	Rex	I'm glad. But you'll have to prove it some day.	game/script.rpy	4204	Rex "[what]"
HREX04_a52cd305	Rex	You'll see what I'm talking about one day.	game/script.rpy	4208	Rex "[what]"
HREX16a_f7a4579e	Rex	She's everything that's wrong with the Mage Council. Authoritarian, controlling, obsessed with power.	game/script.rpy	4217	Rex "[what]"
HREX16a_81304bbb	Rex	You'll never reach your full potential under her.	game/script.rpy	4218	Rex "[what]"
HREX16a_fcc31c4f	Rex	All she wants is to rule you, magic be damned.	game/script.rpy	4219	Rex "[what]"
HREX16a_04d95e87	Rex	Her job is killing people who don't agree with the Mage Council.	game/script.rpy	4222	Rex "[what]"
HREX16a_d7128c42	Rex	Come up with a better argument, you bootlicker.	game/script.rpy	4223	Rex "[what]"
HREX16a_5201fd87	Rex	Who cares what you think?	game/script.rpy	4228	Rex "[what]"
HREX16b_26a8f9cb	Rex	I have a bad history with Eileen. I experimented with some portal magic and summoned an imp. I was just curious, I swear it was an accident!	game/script.rpy	4234	Rex "[what]"
HREX16b_623a78e5	Rex	It was also the only time I thought having magic might be some sort of gift. Eileen cut me down to size pretty quick.	game/script.rpy	4235	Rex "[what]"
HREX16b_de0f3264	Rex	Made me sick, what she did to that imp. I've never forgiven her.	game/script.rpy	4236	Rex "[what]"
HREX16b_5688fced	Rex	I didn't ask to be a mage. Magic took me away from my ma, from my home. Ma wasn't perfect but I still miss her.	game/script.rpy	4237	Rex "[what]"
HREX16b_39ca7f90	Rex	You know? I think you do.	game/script.rpy	4240	Rex "[what]"
HREX16b_98d341f3	Rex	You probably got taken from something you loved, too. Maybe you don't have fire magic tied to demons, but you still got stuck in that prison.	game/script.rpy	4241	Rex "[what]"
HREX16b_04d95e87	Rex	Her job is killing people who don't agree with the Mage Council.	game/script.rpy	4246	Rex "[what]"
HREX16b_d7128c42	Rex	Come up with a better argument, you bootlicker.	game/script.rpy	4247	Rex "[what]"
HREX17_d69b7f3a	Rex	This is the plan: you work on the potion we need for the ritual that'll destroy Eileen's statue. I was never good at that. I have the stone cutter spell.	game/script.rpy	4252	Rex "[what]"
HREX17_cfa99d7d	Rex	Go to the Atrium after curfew. Douse the statue with your potion. For my plan to work, you have to douse the statue before the end of the thursday, otherwise my ritual won't work.	game/script.rpy	4253	Rex "[what]"
HREX17_307bc67d	Rex	It needs time to take effect.	game/script.rpy	4254	Rex "[what]"
HREX17_9ceafa82	Rex	On graduation day, I'll cast the spell, and everyone will watch Eileen's legacy crumble.	game/script.rpy	4255	Rex "[what]"
HREX17_74b86c04	Rex	Are you ready for this?	game/script.rpy	4256	Rex "[what]"
HREX17_f0cc5668	Rex	Good.	game/script.rpy	4259	Rex "[what]"
HREX18_6a32e3ad	Rex	What do you mean? Getting cold feet on me?	game/script.rpy	4264	Rex "[what]"
HREX18_13a1548f	Rex	Have you met me?	game/script.rpy	4267	Rex "[what]"
HREX18_8cd69c97	Rex	Ha. I'm gonna be the mage Eileen and the Council never forget. You're free to study with the others if you want.	game/script.rpy	4270	Rex "[what]"
HREX18_1ac879cc	Rex	Happy to hear it.	game/script.rpy	4273	Rex "[what]"
HREX18_0d28a572	Rex	So you are getting cold feet. Gonna run to the proctors?	game/script.rpy	4276	Rex "[what]"
HREX18_ac2acb7b		Good. Don't.	game/script.rpy	4279	"[what]"
HREX18_468ec619	Rex	Make up your mind.	game/script.rpy	4285	Rex "[what]"
HREX18_c9777f31	Rex	You only think that because the Scholomance taught us that.	game/script.rpy	4290	Rex "[what]"
HREX18_8796fd3f	Rex	I dunno what I believe. All I know is that there's something more out there.	game/script.rpy	4293	Rex "[what]"
HREX18_251285d0	Rex	But they want to distract us from it by building statues to each other.	game/script.rpy	4294	Rex "[what]"
HREX18_bd4d46f5	Rex	Ha. Eileen and the Council already think I'm the villain. I've got nothing to lose. 	game/script.rpy	4297	Rex "[what]"
HREX18_f0ef673f	Rex	Alright. I'm listening. How do you figure?	game/script.rpy	4300	Rex "[what]"
HREX18_642f16f7	Rex	I don't feel responsible for a bunch of people I've never met.	game/script.rpy	4305	Rex "[what]"
HREX18_3a96def7	Rex	Well, they don't.	game/script.rpy	4308	Rex "[what]"
HREX18_227bce1a	Rex	A clean break. Ya. I think I like that. That way, they'll never be able to hold it over my head.	game/script.rpy	4313	Rex "[what]"
HREX18_fd206988	Rex	And I'll never have to think about the Summit again.	game/script.rpy	4314	Rex "[what]"
HREX18_5e95df85	Rex	...	game/script.rpy	4315	Rex "[what]"
HREX18_0087aba3	Rex	I'm calling off the plan. We can still, erm, hang out though. A bit later.	game/script.rpy	4316	Rex "[what]"
melody2hub_main_73a12f84	Melody2	Hmm?	game/script.rpy	4332	Melody2 "[what]"
melody2hub_main_e728732b	Melody2	Don't be a stranger.	game/script.rpy	4413	Melody2 "[what]"
melody2hub_main_7b88893d	Melody2	Bye.	game/script.rpy	4416	Melody2 "[what]"
melody2hub_main_0c94c795	Melody2	Hmm, you're going? Bye.	game/script.rpy	4419	Melody2 "[what]"
melody2hub_main_60056b88	Melody2	We'll talk.	game/script.rpy	4422	Melody2 "[what]"
HMEL27_57edf51d	Melody2	You want to know whether we're friends?	game/script.rpy	4431	Melody2 "[what]"
HMEL27_b95a32d1	Melody2	Ha. That's the sort of question the ditzy overly nice girl I pretend to be would ask.	game/script.rpy	4432	Melody2 "[what]"
HMEL27_cb77760f	Melody2	Wait, you're serious?	game/script.rpy	4435	Melody2 "[what]"
HMEL27_8b41d104	Melody2	Sure. We're friends. I mean what's the phrase -- {i}honour among thieves.{/i} For us, I guess we have a kinship.	game/script.rpy	4438	Melody2 "[what]"
HMEL27_da50e326		{i}Mages of a feather, or whatever.{/i} If what we're doing now isn't considered friendship, I don't know what is.	game/script.rpy	4439	"[what]"
HMEL27_6639cdbb	Melody2	None in the Scholomance, that's for sure.	game/script.rpy	4442	Melody2 "[what]"
HMEL27_e8359c03	Melody2	I don't think I ever trusted anyone there. Who would? If you're not the best you'll get screwed over.	game/script.rpy	4443	Melody2 "[what]"
HMEL27_edac98c8	Melody2	That's probably why we're being open about it now. I know you'll screw other people over to get ahead.	game/script.rpy	4444	Melody2 "[what]"
HMEL27_f7716abe	Melody2	You know I'll do the same -- there's no backstabbing there.	game/script.rpy	4445	Melody2 "[what]"
HMEL27_eb445106	Melody2	Plus, it's exhausting to keep the facade up.	game/script.rpy	4448	Melody2 "[what]"
HMEL27_dd963463	Melody2	We'll see.	game/script.rpy	4451	Melody2 "[what]"
HMEL21_9889f5d0	Melody2	I've always dreamed of going to the city -- the Scholomance was always a route to that. I like having magic, who wouldn't?	game/script.rpy	4455	Melody2 "[what]"
HMEL21_32cac2a1	Melody2	But I'm going to love my time in the city so much more. So much to do.	game/script.rpy	4456	Melody2 "[what]"
HMEL21_13feba15	Melody2	I won't be sequestered off to a backwater town where the most interesting thing that can happen is a travelling band or someone dying.	game/script.rpy	4457	Melody2 "[what]"
HMEL21_d7ac4ee5	Melody2	I won't be put through that again. 	game/script.rpy	4458	Melody2 "[what]"
HMEL22_a42de669	Melody2	The village I'm from had, max, fifty people in it. All of them old, all of them obstinate. The only thing to do there was count flowers in the fields and swim in a freezing ocean. I hated it, it was the sort of place people like me are imprisoned in.	game/script.rpy	4462	Melody2 "[what]"
HMEL22_7772840a	Melody2	The second my magic manifested I knew it was my ticket out. Wish come true, really. I'm never going back there.	game/script.rpy	4463	Melody2 "[what]"
HMEL22_ccfca5a0	Melody2	There wasn't anything my parents did wrong. They were simply happy living a simple life in a quiet place.	game/script.rpy	4466	Melody2 "[what]"
HMEL22_c0d4c3c8	Melody2	The village might as well have been at the end of the world -- isolated on a small island with nothing going in and out.	game/script.rpy	4467	Melody2 "[what]"
HMEL22_ed738476	Melody2	It's the sort of place you go to die.	game/script.rpy	4468	Melody2 "[what]"
HMEL22_8d5b8281	Melody2	Everyone was older than twenty when I was {i}born{/i}. There was no one my age to talk to so I spent most of my time with birds and make-believe friends.	game/script.rpy	4472	Melody2 "[what]"
HMEL22_360d8560	Melody2	Again, what other option did I have? This isn't me telling you some sob story -- if anything, I'm being open with you.	game/script.rpy	4475	Melody2 "[what]"
HMEL22_54155466	Melody2	I made do.	game/script.rpy	4479	Melody2 "[what]"
HMEL22_b1bd67c0	Melody2	If that's all, you can stop prying. After graduation we probably won't ever see each other again...	game/script.rpy	4484	Melody2 "[what]"
HMEL22_962550fa	Melody2	...but still, I'd rather not make friendship bracelets and fairy chains right now.	game/script.rpy	4485	Melody2 "[what]"
HMEL24a_3ccc521c	Melody2	You know, messing with Tao's potion was more fun than I thought it'd be.	game/script.rpy	4492	Melody2 "[what]"
HMEL24a_fafdbd70	Melody2	Sometimes. It depends on the person.	game/script.rpy	4495	Melody2 "[what]"
HMEL24a_954033d0	Melody2	Messing with Xander's grade is like pushing over a toddler -- not {i}that{/i} fun. But with Tao I know there's stakes.	game/script.rpy	4496	Melody2 "[what]"
HMEL24b_5cf779aa	Melody2	Tao is insufferable.	game/script.rpy	4501	Melody2 "[what]"
HMEL24b_6234fbec	Melody2	If {i}I{/i} was the child of an accomplished mage I simply {i}wouldn't{/i} be an insufferable nutjob with no personality, charm, or ability to make a single friend in their seven years of studying.	game/script.rpy	4502	Melody2 "[what]"
HMEL24b_aef5c3e3	Melody2	As much as I like being alone, I'm smart enough to know how to play nice.	game/script.rpy	4503	Melody2 "[what]"
HMEL24b_7c6b5a86	Melody2	Fake it til you make it… or end up alone behind a desk at the back of a building filing papers because no one else wants to deal with you.	game/script.rpy	4504	Melody2 "[what]"
HMEL24b_9f0702ef	Melody2	Like it or not, being sociable and {i}*scoff*{/i} personable, is as important as being smart and reliable nowadays.	game/script.rpy	4505	Melody2 "[what]"
HMEL24b_30b24811	Melody2	It doesn't matter what level of nepotism Tao was born into, they'll be a failure if they can't grasp the basics of being nice to talk to.	game/script.rpy	4506	Melody2 "[what]"
HMEL24b_205b7ab6	Melody2	And this isn't me being {i}biassed{/i} because they're probably the biggest roadblock I have to the city spot -- they just aren't nice to be around.	game/script.rpy	4507	Melody2 "[what]"
HMEL24b_e7d627d2	Melody2	If that's how it reads I doubt you've had to talk to Tao in any meaningful way.	game/script.rpy	4510	Melody2 "[what]"
HMEL24b_93d44582	Melody2	Shame.	game/script.rpy	4513	Melody2 "[what]"
HMEL24b_ec4cdebb	Melody2	Absolutely. If you haven't noticed, the average person is not smart.	game/script.rpy	4516	Melody2 "[what]"
HMEL24b_49bb27fd	Melody2	Dumb people are loud, confidence is convincing, and being capable of putting the right words in a row usually means people perceive you as smarter than you actually are.	game/script.rpy	4517	Melody2 "[what]"
HMEL24b_6baedc37	Melody2	What this means for Tao is that no one will listen to anything they have to say because they won't say it eloquently, nicely, or with enough charisma to be convincing.	game/script.rpy	4518	Melody2 "[what]"
HMEL24b_8ac765f1	Melody2	A small number of people in the room will actually internalise what someone is telling them and think it through...	game/script.rpy	4519	Melody2 "[what]"
HMEL24b_4fb58f23	Melody2	...if I sounded reasonable and intelligent enough I could easily have gotten half the people in the Scholomance to inadvertently kill themselves by suggesting they create potions that {i}sounded{/i} right but were actually noxious gas.	game/script.rpy	4520	Melody2 "[what]"
HMEL24b_e2584b76	Melody2	 I wouldn't, obviously. But that's not the point -- Tao is smarter than me.	game/script.rpy	4521	Melody2 "[what]"
HMEL24b_e6c0ef1b	Melody2	They study harder, learn quicker, think better -- in athletic terms, they're a track star, but the sad truth is that no one gives a crap what the smart person has to say -- they care what the charismatic one does.	game/script.rpy	4522	Melody2 "[what]"
HMEL24b_06438abe	Melody2	If people don't like you, they will not listen to you, and Tao is allergic to being likeable.	game/script.rpy	4523	Melody2 "[what]"
HMEL24b_fcb0fe05	Melody2	It's a good lesson to us though -- watching someone with everything going for them self-sabotage does remind you of what's important.	game/script.rpy	4525	Melody2 "[what]"
HMEL24b_ac192d1f	Melody2	Maybe they'll improve... maybe not.	game/script.rpy	4526	Melody2 "[what]"
HMEL24b_95a45ca5	Melody2	The way I see it is we shouldn't let a good spot go to waste on someone who will not have the power to utilise it.	game/script.rpy	4527	Melody2 "[what]"
HMEL24b_1d173a15	Melody2	You must see something I don't then.	game/script.rpy	4530	Melody2 "[what]"
HMEL24b_b06a4385	Melody2	If that motivates you, sure. Why not?	game/script.rpy	4533	Melody2 "[what]"
HMEL24b_8cad042b	Melody2	You can. I don't really care all that much.	game/script.rpy	4536	Melody2 "[what]"
HMEL24b_c631067e	Melody2	Just remember, they're still the main contender to sabotage. Don't get attached to a bear cub. It might be cute, but it'll kill you one day.	game/script.rpy	4539	Melody2 "[what]"
HMEL25_5a9b5037	Melody2	Aria's... fine. She's annoying, but her being here is more often helpful than not.	game/script.rpy	4544	Melody2 "[what]"
HMEL25_a08a3c0a	Melody2	On one hand, Aria can be a threat, academically, when she puts her mind to it.	game/script.rpy	4545	Melody2 "[what]"
HMEL25_8e678153	Melody2	On the other hand, she usually causes some hijinx or issue due to how unstable her magic can be...	game/script.rpy	4546	Melody2 "[what]"
HMEL25_69bfba5a	Melody2	...meaning a lot of Eileen and Alice's attention is on her, which is helpful when we're trying to not get caught.	game/script.rpy	4547	Melody2 "[what]"
HMEL25_2307a5ae	Melody2	Still not being able to control your powers into your twenties is embarrassing -- most of us had ourselves under control in our teens...	game/script.rpy	4548	Melody2 "[what]"
HMEL25_a19449ca	Melody2	...she's too old for this sort of problem. I don't even know why they put her up for graduation.	game/script.rpy	4549	Melody2 "[what]"
HMEL25_ad0ed170	Melody2	Maybe they just want to get rid of her.	game/script.rpy	4550	Melody2 "[what]"
HMEL25_b8b69908	Melody2	It's a shame, right? The girl can grow a garden by daydreaming but can't be bothered to be normal for five minutes.	game/script.rpy	4551	Melody2 "[what]"
HMEL25_99d3720c	Melody2	She's born lucky to have that sort of power, but she's also lucky they haven't put her in some mage prison or something -- her power is probably making the council pensive.	game/script.rpy	4552	Melody2 "[what]"
HMEL25_1387ad90	Melody2	What else do you do with someone capable of that sort of destruction? I wouldn't feel safe being alone with her if she had a bad day...	game/script.rpy	4555	Melody2 "[what]"
HMEL25_3da98b2d	Melody2	...half of us would end up being collateral. Locking that sort of person up is much better than the {i}obvious{/i} alternative.	game/script.rpy	4556	Melody2 "[what]"
HMEL25_271ad4fc	Melody2	'Subduing' her, permanently.	game/script.rpy	4559	Melody2 "[what]"
HMEL25_047b3455	Melody2	We all know Eileen's done it before -- at least, if we're reading between the lines of those history books.	game/script.rpy	4560	Melody2 "[what]"
HMEL25_2f3c4162	Melody2	I'm sure those problematic rogue mages didn't just decide to concede.	game/script.rpy	4561	Melody2 "[what]"
HMEL25_3dcd9a3b	Melody2	It's not the nicest thought. In a way I really like Aria, I just wish she could manage herself better. It's annoying to watch someone born so lucky have such basic, solvable problems.	game/script.rpy	4562	Melody2 "[what]"
HMEL25_970bb54d	Melody2	Make you wish you'd been born that lucky yourself.	game/script.rpy	4563	Melody2 "[what]"
HMEL25_40fd0738	Melody2	I'm sure she'll figure it out eventually at whatever backwater town she ends up in.	game/script.rpy	4564	Melody2 "[what]"
HMEL28_fbd4c8a2	Melody2	Rex is about as bright as a cave. He puts on a show, 'oh look at me I'm edgy, I hate authority,' but anyone who really hated authority wouldn't be here, they'd have burned the school down.	game/script.rpy	4568	Melody2 "[what]"
HMEL28_ab23f32b	Melody2	Anarchists are only as useful as their ability to commit to it. He needs to learn to play the long game.	game/script.rpy	4569	Melody2 "[what]"
HMEL29_d88ae101	Melody2	Alice told me the slots when I arrived -- she mentioned one of the spots is near my hometown.	game/script.rpy	4576	Melody2 "[what]"
HMEL29_80056f46	Melody2	I will not be going to that one. I read up on each of them in the library… the five are:	game/script.rpy	4577	Melody2 "[what]"
HMEL29_5ff1a68d	Melody2	{i}Lyra Plains{/i}, a desert town to the south. It's small, set up around an oasis called the Lyranic Oasis. I don't do well in heat.	game/script.rpy	4578	Melody2 "[what]"
HMEL29_bd5b1602	Melody2	{i}Jubilee Grove{/i} was another one. I've not actually read too much on it other than it's super rural and surrounded by farmland...	game/script.rpy	4579	Melody2 "[what]"
HMEL29_5bf44bfc	Melody2	...sounds like the sort of place that would drive me insane.	game/script.rpy	4580	Melody2 "[what]"
HMEL29_56948213	Melody2	{i}Willow Peaks{/i} was in the mountains somewhere. Looks boring.	game/script.rpy	4581	Melody2 "[what]"
HMEL29_b11d90a7	Melody2	<i>Tomis Village</i> was like… a few hours away from my hometown. It's a small town on the coast -- I remember we used to get produce from there sometimes.	game/script.rpy	4582	Melody2 "[what]"
HMEL29_f8b0a696	Melody2	I'd rather not have to be that close to my parents, and a small fishing town does not sound like the sort of place I want to spend my time.	game/script.rpy	4583	Melody2 "[what]"
HMEL29_a07cfd31	Melody2	Finally, {i}Ilara City{/i} is where I want to go. The regional capital. It's a big, sprawling city with tens of thousands of people living there.	game/script.rpy	4584	Melody2 "[what]"
HMEL29_2fe4cc80	Melody2	It's not a crappy little town, it's a city -- that spot is mine.	game/script.rpy	4585	Melody2 "[what]"
HMEL29_aca19425	Melody2	There could be more spots, but those are the ones Alice mentioned. Four rocks and one diamond. I doubt it's a coincidence there are only five of us graduating from this set.	game/script.rpy	4586	Melody2 "[what]"
HMEL29_3ed94d7d	Melody2	Maybe these are the towns that either didn't have a town mage, for whatever reason. 	game/script.rpy	4587	Melody2 "[what]"
HMEL30_202562b6	Melody2	I doubt you need to study that hard for these exams. You're not an idiot like the rest of them.	game/script.rpy	4593	Melody2 "[what]"
HMEL31a_0eccc842	Melody2	It went fine. I've never been great in combat -- it's not something I particularly enjoy. I doubt I'll need that skill in the city -- surely there will be other mages for that.	game/script.rpy	4597	Melody2 "[what]"
HMEL31a_d7b53f02	Melody2	I'm guessing you did well?	game/script.rpy	4598	Melody2 "[what]"
HMEL31a_f7a699f3		As long as your average grade was fine, it shouldn't matter. That's why it's graded on a curve, I guess.	game/script.rpy	4601	"[what]"
HMEL31a_01e45332	Melody2	Hmm.	game/script.rpy	4605	Melody2 "[what]"
HMEL31b_5a0aa665	Melody2	I have a few tricks up my sleeve for the combat exam. I'm not going to do as well as someone like Xander, but I know I'll pass.	game/script.rpy	4611	Melody2 "[what]"
HMEL33a_2939d302	Melody2	Well, that was easy. Why does everyone else look so pale?	game/script.rpy	4618	Melody2 "[what]"
HMEL33a_1c9cd9ee		Hmm. Shame.	game/script.rpy	4621	"[what]"
HMEL33a_f5268eae		Never doubted you…	game/script.rpy	4625	"[what]"
HMEL33a_70f938ab	Melody2	I think everyone else did not enjoy that. Rex looks like he's gonna blow something up.	game/script.rpy	4628	Melody2 "[what]"
HMEL33b_0bb1d121	Melody2	Potions are my strong suit. I'll be fine.	game/script.rpy	4633	Melody2 "[what]"
HMEL33b_adfb1e19	Melody2	Potions are needed by everyone. If you're good at it, you basically end up being a pseudo authority.	game/script.rpy	4637	Melody2 "[what]"
HMEL33b_529e4a8b	Melody2	They sell for a lot, they're easy to make once you know the recipe, but still, somehow, people mess it up.	game/script.rpy	4638	Melody2 "[what]"
HMEL33b_c4226b27	Melody2	I've heard about mages who retired by writing one or two potion recipe books -- everyone wants them.	game/script.rpy	4639	Melody2 "[what]"
HMEL33b_bd129655	Melody2	When I figured all that out, it was just a point of studying a lot and making sure I practised regularly.	game/script.rpy	4640	Melody2 "[what]"
HMEL35a_bd0ab3d5	Melody2	That went better than expected. I thought the artificing exam would be the hardest one but...	game/script.rpy	4644	Melody2 "[what]"
HMEL35a_bbd1355a	Melody2	...well, that was fine. Much easier than the written exam's we had at the Scholomance. How did you do?	game/script.rpy	4645	Melody2 "[what]"
HMEL35a_a03a7c78	Melody2	Well… let's hope you did well on your other tests…	game/script.rpy	4648	Melody2 "[what]"
HMEL35a_d12fcac0	Melody2	Never doubted you...	game/script.rpy	4652	Melody2 "[what]"
HMEL35b_5ed5f4ff	Melody2	Artificing shouldn't be too hard. I've probably spent the most time studying for it.	game/script.rpy	4658	Melody2 "[what]"
HMEL35b_de94cff9	Melody2	As long as we make it out of the exam alive I think we'll pass.	game/script.rpy	4659	Melody2 "[what]"
HMEL35b_0b8062f6		We're in a room with Rex. He could just blow us up. You never know. Intentionally or not, some artificing is dangerous.	game/script.rpy	4662	"[what]"
HMEL37_15103864	Melody2	I don't know what you mean by 'not Alice'... you sound a little crazy so I'm gonna recommend you don't trust whatever it was you saw.	game/script.rpy	4669	Melody2 "[what]"
HMEL37_cd516861	Melody2	This is me being very firm but very friendly, be careful.	game/script.rpy	4670	Melody2 "[what]"
HMEL37_8fa72d1e	Melody2	I've read that some creatures can take on human form... trusting it enough to get close will probably get you killed.	game/script.rpy	4671	Melody2 "[what]"
HMEL37_444d64d8	Melody2	It could have been one of Alice's dolls, but I trust you're smart enough to tell the difference.	game/script.rpy	4672	Melody2 "[what]"
HMEL37_ce16ee5f		Are you insane? No. Whatever is in that forest will hopefully stay there. I'd rather not see it in the flesh -- or... porcelain, whatever it has.	game/script.rpy	4675	"[what]"
HMEL37_91794fc1	Melody2	Good… Even if you're somewhat a rival, I don't want you dead.	game/script.rpy	4679	Melody2 "[what]"
HMEL38_0cb4a9ed	Melody2	Did I lie to you about my first manifestation… I probably did. Disregard a lot of it.	game/script.rpy	4684	Melody2 "[what]"
HMEL38_4386601e	Melody2	It's easier for someone like Aria or Xander to relate to the idea that it manifested when I was scared -- because that's most mages, right?	game/script.rpy	4685	Melody2 "[what]"
HMEL38_36daaf38	Melody2	The first time my magic manifested I was very angry. My parents had promised me a dog if I did well on a test.	game/script.rpy	4686	Melody2 "[what]"
HMEL38_6001c123	Melody2	I studied every day and had to travel a few hours to the nearby town to take the test.	game/script.rpy	4687	Melody2 "[what]"
HMEL38_244411e6	Melody2	I was so excited that I got the teacher to mark it before I left so I could bring it back home with me.	game/script.rpy	4688	Melody2 "[what]"
HMEL38_257aca28	Melody2	When I got home my parents told me they weren't going to get me a dog -- we didn't have the space and they didn't want to deal with the cleaning associated with it...	game/script.rpy	4689	Melody2 "[what]"
HMEL38_e0bb1caf	Melody2	...despite me saying I would clean it.	game/script.rpy	4690	Melody2 "[what]"
HMEL38_e5f40159	Melody2	I got so angry. I just felt this haze travelling over me, then through me. I could barely breathe, I just wanted to scream.	game/script.rpy	4691	Melody2 "[what]"
HMEL38_ea79e425	Melody2	When I opened my eyes, the entire house was dark. I'd turned every single window and piece of glass in our house completely opaque.	game/script.rpy	4692	Melody2 "[what]"
HMEL38_f019f62d	Melody2	My parents were worried… I think they knew before I did what I'd done.	game/script.rpy	4693	Melody2 "[what]"
HMEL38_f872aada	Melody2	I remember my mother scolding me, seemingly out of instinct, and when she did I screamed again...	game/script.rpy	4694	Melody2 "[what]"
HMEL38_4499c9b2	Melody2	...but this time instead of turning the glass opaque or fixing it, the windows shattered one by one.	game/script.rpy	4695	Melody2 "[what]"
HMEL38_c5664546	Melody2	I wasn't even screaming when the kitchen window burst, I was mystified.	game/script.rpy	4696	Melody2 "[what]"
HMEL38_72be1b82	Melody2	I must've scared them a lot because a few days later they shipped me off to the Scholomance.	game/script.rpy	4697	Melody2 "[what]"
HMEL38_5480ea07	Melody2	Smash the glass? A little. I wanted the glass to smash and it did so on that level I'm culpable.	game/script.rpy	4700	Melody2 "[what]"
HMEL38_388296fc	Melody2	Whatever that means.	game/script.rpy	4701	Melody2 "[what]"
HMEL38_b97313d3	Melody2	They're fine. If my daughter was suddenly intensely angry and powerful I would probably send her off somewhere far away from me.	game/script.rpy	4705	Melody2 "[what]"
HMEL38_2298b811	Melody2	It's not like I was going to hurt them, but then again, who knows what I was and was not in control of at that point.	game/script.rpy	4706	Melody2 "[what]"
HMEL38_19f8d30a	Melody2	I didn't want to go to the Scholomance, but I didn't want to stay at home. That small town always felt too small. My parents had me trade out one prison for another.	game/script.rpy	4709	Melody2 "[what]"
HMEL38_06a76467	Melody2	Perhaps prison's a bit intense to describe the Scholomance but, really, would any of us wanted to attend that place.	game/script.rpy	4710	Melody2 "[what]"
HMEL38_b4e6d402	Melody2	I think manifesting magic was worth a childhood cut short. It's a price we all paid.	game/script.rpy	4711	Melody2 "[what]"
HMEL38_6e978891	Melody2	But that price is too much if I get sent back to a small little town old people die in.	game/script.rpy	4712	Melody2 "[what]"
HMEL39_85e0628f	Melody2	You want to know my thoughts on Mage Society… I guess it's a big club, when you think about it.	game/script.rpy	4716	Melody2 "[what]"
HMEL39_162d0585	Melody2	Then again, all things are when they're insular and what's more isolating than being a mage.	game/script.rpy	4717	Melody2 "[what]"
HMEL39_5e305fdb	Melody2	We're a tiny minority of the population and the governance we have is essentially a bunch of people who know each other and were lucky to be there first.	game/script.rpy	4718	Melody2 "[what]"
HMEL39_983165a6	Melody2	I'm guessing the Mage Council and Association is full of nepotism -- how could it not be.	game/script.rpy	4719	Melody2 "[what]"
HMEL39_43104de6	Melody2	Who's going to trust some random mage they've never met to sort things out with other people.	game/script.rpy	4720	Melody2 "[what]"
HMEL39_be85ae65	Melody2	It seems to me like it's all about power and pleasing those with it. How can any mage tell Eileen what to do?	game/script.rpy	4721	Melody2 "[what]"
HMEL39_0c8ca0ea	Melody2	She's essentially capable of killing them with a flick of her wrist. She doesn't, why? Because they appease her.	game/script.rpy	4722	Melody2 "[what]"
HMEL39_eac458bd	Melody2	She wants a statue, they build a statue, she wants to hunt rogue mages, she's allowed to.	game/script.rpy	4723	Melody2 "[what]"
HMEL39_64c4dc6c	Melody2	Then, with Eileen on their side, what opposing mage faction could function?	game/script.rpy	4724	Melody2 "[what]"
HMEL39_d66543b3	Melody2	It's like two people hitting each other with sticks -- the one with the longer stick's going to have an advantage.	game/script.rpy	4725	Melody2 "[what]"
HMEL39_20533b0a	Melody2	Mage Society seems like something you have to really be invited into...	game/script.rpy	4726	Melody2 "[what]"
HMEL39_b7dfd311	Melody2	I have a few ideas on who I could use to get in but getting the city spot is step one. The city, after all, is the best place to network	game/script.rpy	4727	Melody2 "[what]"
HMEL39_53340198	Melody2	...	game/script.rpy	4728	Melody2 "[what]"
HMEL39_d5257f34	Melody2	What a rant...	game/script.rpy	4729	Melody2 "[what]"
alicehub_main_db7eca35	Alice	What do you need??	game/script.rpy	4743	Alice "[what]"
alicehub_main_bcfead80	Alice	See you.	game/script.rpy	4801	Alice "[what]"
alicehub_main_f4002fca	Alice	See you soon!	game/script.rpy	4804	Alice "[what]"
alicehub_main_a2241bb2	Alice	Let me know if you need anything.	game/script.rpy	4807	Alice "[what]"
alicehub_main_21e1328b	Alice	Come back if you need anything.	game/script.rpy	4810	Alice "[what]"
HALI01_a27cbba1	Alice	Hmm... I always get questions about my personal life.	game/script.rpy	4827	Alice "[what]"
HALI01_1bfe851a	Alice	I suppose the summary is that I was raised by an artisan family. I'd say I'm still more artisan than mage.	game/script.rpy	4829	Alice "[what]"
HALI01_5632714f	Alice	The dolls are an extension of that -- my family worked with porcelain. I've not seen them in a while, but I'd imagine they still do.	game/script.rpy	4830	Alice "[what]"
HALI01_8541bac9	Alice	My magic manifested rather late, late enough into my teens that I'd already devised a life I wanted -- magic was a curveball to that...	game/script.rpy	4831	Alice "[what]"
HALI01_846e8676	Alice	...as I imagine it was to you and your classmates. While in the Scholomance I dreaded what my life would look like...	game/script.rpy	4832	Alice "[what]"
HALI01_0b5d5b51	Alice	but after a few bad nights crying I realised I could combine magic with what I wanted.	game/script.rpy	4833	Alice "[what]"
HALI01_72360c3b	Alice	Geomancy has some domain over clay and the tools I'd used back home...	game/script.rpy	4834	Alice "[what]"
HALI01_69febc60	Alice	...the only thing stopping me was the looming dread of graduation and a lack of motivation I now realise was probably some sort of depression, which is natural.	game/script.rpy	4835	Alice "[what]"
HALI01_d1b4dd89	Alice	I was dealing with the grief of losing my old life, it's hard to do much with that looming over you.	game/script.rpy	4836	Alice "[what]"
HALI01_34440743	Alice	What I hope you can take from this, is that graduation should be a fresh start. You should be shattering the old and figuring out who you are and what you can bring to other people's lives.	game/script.rpy	4837	Alice "[what]"
HALI01_b793ec5b	Alice	I know your classmates see magic as a curse -- but if you overlook the hardship it comes with, it is really quite the blessing.	game/script.rpy	4838	Alice "[what]"
HALI01_7d4321aa	Alice	I know you're a person who likes to help others, so perhaps that perspective is something that comes more naturally to you than it did for Eileen or I.	game/script.rpy	4839	Alice "[what]"
HALI02_2c353b28	Alice	None of my dolls leave the grounds. That's too many things to keep track of. Are you sure that you saw one? It just seems… unlikely.	game/script.rpy	4847	Alice "[what]"
HALI02_d802cf37	Alice	I'll talk to Eileen. I recommend you don't leave the grounds.	game/script.rpy	4850	Alice "[what]"
HALI02_a993082f	Alice	Hmm. Alright then...	game/script.rpy	4853	Alice "[what]"
HALI03_b6e07bb5	Alice	The teachers noticed, I don't think I've seen this sort of breakdown from them before. We are worried and we're doing what we can to support them.	game/script.rpy	4858	Alice "[what]"
HALI03_e92e952b	Alice	We're afraid of what might happen if they get pulled from the exams -- I sent a dove to Tao's father yesterday, he is on the way.	game/script.rpy	4859	Alice "[what]"
HALI03_3845fa72	Alice	We're going to let Tao do the exams in that state, and I'll try and we will take what is happening into account when judging the grades.	game/script.rpy	4860	Alice "[what]"
HALI03_8e1884f2	Alice	Thank you for looking out for Tao, I know they don't have any friends here, so it's good that you're keeping your eye on them.	game/script.rpy	4861	Alice "[what]"
HALI03_8ff26f9d	Alice	You're a good person.	game/script.rpy	4862	Alice "[what]"
HALI04_536e97cc	Alice	Ah! The mage tree… We have a good friendship -- if you believe people and trees can be friends.	game/script.rpy	4867	Alice "[what]"
HALI04_9a85ae98	Alice	It's unspoken, of course. The Summit was built around the tree. No one knows whether it's just some living enchantment like the Watching Moons are, or whether it's sentient.	game/script.rpy	4868	Alice "[what]"
HALI04_5b085c18	Alice	Either way, it reacts, and acts, and seems to have things it likes. It likes Aria, it likes me... I think Eileen and him are on bad terms, if I'm honest.	game/script.rpy	4869	Alice "[what]"
HALI04_f8bb5339	Alice	I watched it recede a branch away from her when she got close once.	game/script.rpy	4870	Alice "[what]"
HALI06_85c8d7d3	Alice	I like Xander. He has a good heart. I wish he would put less pressure on himself. Same goes to all of you!	game/script.rpy	4874	Alice "[what]"
HALI07_1ea84757	Alice	Ah! Melody. Melody reminds me of myself. Eager. Excited to learn. Often nervous. I think great things are coming to that girl.	game/script.rpy	4878	Alice "[what]"
HALI08_30ded5df	Alice	Hmm. Tao seems to be struggling. I understand why… this must be the most stressful time of your lives. The weight of your future is on your shoulders.	game/script.rpy	4882	Alice "[what]"
HALI08_28665e87	Alice	But Tao's level of anxiety seems unbearable. I just wish I could take it away from them. Worry less... live more... but look out for one another.	game/script.rpy	4883	Alice "[what]"
HALI08_6b2b3292	Alice	No matter how talented and hardworking Tao is, they are still just a young adult who deserves some level of peace through all this.	game/script.rpy	4884	Alice "[what]"
HALI10a_65911808	Alice	It's best not to talk about Aria right now. I'd rather not get heated.	game/script.rpy	4888	Alice "[what]"
HALI10a_a2b90845	Alice	I adore and sympathise with that girl, but she had me worried sick.	game/script.rpy	4889	Alice "[what]"
HALI10b_415fdc8b	Alice	I'm hopeful for Aria's future. Given the right direction she could do anything. The only thing holding her back is control.	game/script.rpy	4893	Alice "[what]"
HALI10b_031d028f	Alice	All that power in a woman so sweet and unstructured leads to its own set of issues.	game/script.rpy	4894	Alice "[what]"
HALI10b_c0e76495	Alice	The nicest people struggle making hard decisions and when you're someone with that level of power, organisation is more so about safety.	game/script.rpy	4895	Alice "[what]"
HALI10b_4d2b4cc7	Alice	The Mage Council will not like the level of power they have to allow Aria to have, it'll take a lot of control from her part to convince them.	game/script.rpy	4896	Alice "[what]"
HALI11_df458a06	Alice	Oh the Summit is just lovely when you have the chance to explore it. Only in the day, of course.	game/script.rpy	4900	Alice "[what]"
HALI11_d77f318c	Alice	It's a very odd place to be on -- this mountain is a centre of magical occurrences so you often get to see some peculiar events.	game/script.rpy	4901	Alice "[what]"
HALI11_90c25eba	Alice	When I first arrived here, the first thing I did was try and figure out how the Watching Moons worked.	game/script.rpy	4902	Alice "[what]"
HALI11_0163d4b6	Alice	Spells like that are often too complex for most students, but I figured it out.	game/script.rpy	4903	Alice "[what]"
HALI11_944ff100	Alice	In fact, that sort of charm is what I used for my dolls.	game/script.rpy	4904	Alice "[what]"
HALI11_45f59e8d	Alice	You'll work it out eventually.	game/script.rpy	4907	Alice "[what]"
HALI12_4f6d05a3	Alice	Those poor statues. All that hard work. At least restoring them shouldn't be too arduous. Still, very selfish of Rex to pull that sort of prank…	game/script.rpy	4913	Alice "[what]"
HALI13_ace3bc61	Alice	You aren't the first to ask me about Mage Society. I get that you're all very curious.	game/script.rpy	4917	Alice "[what]"
HALI13_1c1502a1	Alice	My experiences were... normal.	game/script.rpy	4918	Alice "[what]"
HALI13_009637a9	Alice	The Scholomance prepared me for what I was entering into, I felt ready.	game/script.rpy	4919	Alice "[what]"
HALI13_8d6d890d	Alice	I didn't dislike studying but after the amount I did during my education, Mage Society was a breath of fresh air.	game/script.rpy	4920	Alice "[what]"
HALI13_0622c86e	Alice	I entered and did a job that was assigned to me. After people saw what my talents were in, they moved me towards my current role.	game/script.rpy	4921	Alice "[what]"
HALI13_160122a9	Alice	I'm good with people, so helping other mages who are graduating, in school, out in the workforce, or even just first finding their power, is very aligned with who I am.	game/script.rpy	4922	Alice "[what]"
HALI13_56d787e5	Alice	Try not to feel pensive about what comes next. You will be okay.	game/script.rpy	4923	Alice "[what]"
HALI13_37248dc5	Alice	In a world where everyone heralds freedom, we have to play by other rulesets.	game/script.rpy	4927	Alice "[what]"
HALI13_a8b81cb5	Alice	It must seem odd to you. I mean, the lot of you are in your twenties.	game/script.rpy	4928	Alice "[what]"
HALI13_e1686d62	Alice	When I was in my twenties... the world was a different place.	game/script.rpy	4929	Alice "[what]"
HALI13_5f5e0eb2	Alice	War was always on the horizon... our kin were being hunted down one at a time...	game/script.rpy	4930	Alice "[what]"
HALI13_aca300bc	Alice	Mages are a distruptive force in the world, so we must enforce any structure we can onto them.	game/script.rpy	4931	Alice "[what]"
HALI13_c9ee024a	Alice	It keeps allof us safe.	game/script.rpy	4932	Alice "[what]"
HALI13_e2636b03	Alice	As unpopular as the Mage Council are... they exist for a reason. It wasn't as though there was some power vaccum and they happened to seize it.	game/script.rpy	4933	Alice "[what]"
HALI13_281ab63f	Alice	They were forced to.	game/script.rpy	4934	Alice "[what]"
HALI13_e22bca4d	Alice	As was I. As are you. As are those hundred students in the Scholomance.	game/script.rpy	4935	Alice "[what]"
HALI13_9d06e0f1	Alice	As dreary as it seems. It's {i}this{/i} or it's something much worse.	game/script.rpy	4936	Alice "[what]"
HALI13_dcf58d41	Alice	I try not to ask myself that.	game/script.rpy	4941	Alice "[what]"
HALI13_87a10deb	Alice	I find it tends to ruin my mood.	game/script.rpy	4942	Alice "[what]"
HALI13_fa984dc7	Alice	Life can't be fun forever.	game/script.rpy	4943	Alice "[what]"
HALI13_1596d813	Alice	You're alive to experience fleeting happiness, not everlasting.	game/script.rpy	4944	Alice "[what]"
HALI13_c622565b	Alice	Horrible to say, but it's true.	game/script.rpy	4945	Alice "[what]"
HALI13_a6d90371	Alice	Everything you do will be measured, just like this exam.	game/script.rpy	4946	Alice "[what]"
HALI13_d42a4fa9	Alice	The step of every Mage is held to a higher standard because of the gifts we were born with.	game/script.rpy	4947	Alice "[what]"
HALI13_92ded205	Alice	We aren't allowed a bad day. We aren't allowed to have a drunken row in a pub...	game/script.rpy	4948	Alice "[what]"
HALI13_5e7011a6	Alice	A strong disagreement with a coworker...	game/script.rpy	4949	Alice "[what]"
HALI13_096c64b5	Alice	We're not even allowed to seem outwardly hostile.	game/script.rpy	4950	Alice "[what]"
HALI13_b640796c	Alice	If we live on whims and do as we please all it takes is one bad egg to ruin a peaceful life we have fought hard to attain.	game/script.rpy	4951	Alice "[what]"
HALI13_8859c49b	Alice	I don't want to enter a war. I'm sure none of you do either.	game/script.rpy	4952	Alice "[what]"
HALI13_c6009f04	Alice	I have fun, sometimes.	game/script.rpy	4953	Alice "[what]"
HALI13_3a727c40	Alice	But I like to live in reality, where we sculpt our lives from the clay we're given. You know?	game/script.rpy	4954	Alice "[what]"
HALI13_42763ccd	Alice	Haha...	game/script.rpy	4960	Alice "[what]"
HALI13_4f99e5f4	Alice	Don't you have studying to do?	game/script.rpy	4961	Alice "[what]"
HALI14_0639ca90	Alice	Ha. I've had many jobs after I graduated. Like most of you will be, I was assigned a city position in Estului.	game/script.rpy	4965	Alice "[what]"
HALI14_19fc1899	Alice	It was… interesting, but unfulfilling.	game/script.rpy	4966	Alice "[what]"
HALI14_f4a6cb9f	Alice	Luckily, the Mage Society understood my actual desires and saw talent in me for other things so I was assigned a new role -- an invigilator role.	game/script.rpy	4967	Alice "[what]"
HALI14_005025f2	Alice	My job was to essentially check up on and help other mages who were in my former position.	game/script.rpy	4968	Alice "[what]"
HALI14_52fa58af	Alice	That ended up going well and I was promoted so that I could spread more guidance, and eventually that also meant helping students too.	game/script.rpy	4969	Alice "[what]"
HALI14_f5fc68e4	Alice	It's very rare for people to be able to visit the Scholomance again after they graduate, but I was given that blessing. I found it all fulfilling.	game/script.rpy	4970	Alice "[what]"
HALI14_0a50d28f	Alice	I get to travel -- I love travelling -- and I get to spend time on my hobbies while doing so.	game/script.rpy	4971	Alice "[what]"
HALI14_04350a47	Alice	Eileen and I have a very privileged job. The only thing it lacks is companionship -- it's very rare that the two of us are in the same place.	game/script.rpy	4972	Alice "[what]"
HALI14_1e4a1569	Alice	I've been asking the Council to assign me an apprentice, but I have doubts they'll allow that until they find the right fit.	game/script.rpy	4973	Alice "[what]"
